      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;secure-proxmox-ve-based-on-debian-12-with-fail2ban&#34;&gt;Secure Proxmox VE based on Debian 12 with fail2ban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to secure a public Proxmox server against brute force attacks is to use the tool ‘fail2ban’.
In this short tutorial, I will show you how to use fail2ban to secure access to the ‘SSH’ service and port ‘8006’ of the dashboard.
Starting point
In this scenario, we are dealing with a Proxmox server that is hosted as a dedicated server at Hetzner and can be reached via the public Internet using an IPv4 and IPv6 address.
In general, the use of fail2ban should only be considered as part of a set of security measures to secure your server. Feel free to consult further security measures here on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
