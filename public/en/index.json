[{"categories":["Linux","Tutorials","Network"],"contents":"The traceroute command in Linux with comprehensive instructions and examples The traceroute command is an indispensable network diagnostic tool for IT security managers and system administrators. It allows you to trace the path that data packets take from your system to a destination on the network, helping you to identify and resolve network problems. In this article, I would like to give you a closer look at the functionality of traceroute.\nWhat is traceroute? traceroute is a command line tool that determines the transport path of IP data packets between the local computer and a selected remote station. It measures the response time of the routers passed through, which helps identify delays and network problems.\nHow traceroute works The tool cleverly uses the Time-to-Live (TTL) field in IP packets:\nFirst probe: traceroute sends a packet with TTL=1 to the destination. Router response: The first router reduces TTL to 0 and sends back a “Time Exceeded” message. Identification: traceroute notes the IP address of this router. Repetition: The TTL value is increased by 1 and the process is repeated. Destination reached: This continues until the destination is reached or the maximum of 30 hops is reached. By default, traceroute sends three probe packets per hop and displays the response times in milliseconds. Installing traceroute Traceroute is not installed by default on all Linux distributions. It can be installed using the package manager:\nUbuntu/Debian-based systems: 1sudo apt update 2sudo apt install traceroute CentOS/RHEL/Fedora: 1sudo yum install traceroute 2# or on newer systems: 3sudo dnf install traceroute Checking the installation: 1traceroute --version Basic usage Simple traceroute command: 1traceroute google.com Example output:\n1traceroute to google.com (172.217.23.14), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 2 31 10.8.8.1 (10.8.8.1) 14.499 ms 15.335 ms 15.956 ms 42 h37-220-13-49.host.redstation.co.uk (37.220.13.49) 17.811 ms 18.669 ms/images/posts/linux/traceroute.png 19.346 ms 53 92.zone.2.c.dc9.redstation.co.uk (185.20.96.137) 19.096 ms 19.757 ms 20.892 ms Interpretation of the output: First line: Destination host, IP address, maximum hops (30), packet size (60 bytes) Each hop line: Hop number, host name/IP address, three response times in milliseconds Practical application examples 1. Force traceroute with IPv4: 1traceroute -4 google.com 2. Traceroute with IPv6: 1traceroute -6 google.com 3. Use ICMP packets (instead of UDP): 1traceroute -I google.com 4. TCP-based traceroute (for firewall bypass): 1traceroute -T -p 80 google.com 5. Without name resolution (faster): 1traceroute -n google.com 6. Limit maximum number of hops: 1traceroute -m 15 google.com 7. Change number of probes per hop: 1traceroute -q 1 google.com 8. Adjust wait time: 1traceroute -w 3 google.com 9. Use specific interface: 1traceroute -i eth0 google.com 10. MTU detection: 1traceroute --mtu google.com Differences between various traceroute methods UDP (default under Linux): Uses “unlikely” ports (33434-33534) Target host responds with “ICMP Port Unreachable” when reached ICMP (with -I option): Uses ICMP Echo Request packets Similar to ping, but with TTL manipulation TCP (with -T option): Uses TCP SYN packets Useful for bypassing firewalls Default port: 80 (HTTP) Overview of all traceroute options Overview of all available traceroute options with descriptions and examples\nTroubleshooting and common problems Asterisk (*) in the output: Meaning: No response within the timeout period Possible causes: Firewall, router configuration, overload Additional annotations: !H: Host unreachable !N: Network unreachable !P: Protocol unreachable !F**: Fragmentation needed !X**: Communication administratively prohibited Performance optimization: 1# For more stable results with problematic connections: 2traceroute -N 1 -w 5 google.com 3# For faster results without DNS resolution: 4traceroute -n google.com Differences from Windows tracert While Linux uses traceroute UDP packets by default, Windows uses tracert ICMP packets. To achieve the same behavior on Linux as on Windows, use:\n1traceroute -I google.com Advanced use for IT security AS path lookups for routing analysis: 1traceroute -A google.com Firewall tests with different ports: 1traceroute -T -p 443 bank-website.com # HTTPS 2traceroute -T -p 25 mail-server.com # SMTP Check network segmentation: 1traceroute -s 192.168.1.100 internal-server.com Best practices for IT security managers Combine traceroute with other tools: Use ping and mtr for comprehensive diagnostics Document baselines: Save normal traceroute results for comparison Monitor critical paths: Regular traceroute tests to important servers Be aware of data protection: traceroute can reveal network structures Use different methods: TCP, ICMP, and UDP for a complete view Conclusion | traceroute on Linux The traceroute command is a powerful tool for network diagnostics and should be part of every IT security toolkit. By understanding its various options and uses, you can efficiently identify and resolve network issues.\nQuestions and answers If you have any questions or feedback about this blog or YouTube channel, please use my help page.

It is important to note that the use of nmap, outside of its test/laboratory or production environment, may only be done with the consent of its owner!\nWith this article, I hope to give you a clear understanding of the powerful tool ‘nmap’ and also provide you with a PDF download of the most commonly used nmap commands. Nmap is ideal for putting your IT infrastructure through its paces and is also the first vector in 99% of cases when penetration testing systems.\nWhat is Nmap? Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. As an IT security professional, Nmap is one of the most important tools in your arsenal for assessing network security. It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.\nMain purposes of Nmap:\nReal-time information about a network Detailed information about all active IPs on the network Number of open ports on a network Provide a list of active hosts Port, OS, and host scanning Installing Nmap Nmap is available in most Linux distributions and can be easily installed:\nDebian/Ubuntu:\n1sudo apt-get install nmap CentOS/RedHat:\n1yum install nmap Fedora:\n1sudo dnf install nmap Basic syntax The basic syntax of Nmap is\n1nmap [scan type(s)] [options] {target specification} Call nmap-help 1nmap -h Output nmap -h\nImportant scan techniques in detail 1. TCP SYN scan (-sS) - The “stealth” scan The TCP SYN scan is the standard and most popular scan option. It is also known as a “stealth scan” or “half-open scan” because it never establishes complete TCP connections.\n1nmap -sS 192.168.1.1 How it works:\nSends SYN packets to target ports For open ports: Receives SYN/ACK response For closed ports: Receives RST response For filtered ports: No response (firewall) Advantages: Fast and inconspicuous Works against any TCP stack Clear distinction between open, closed, and filtered 2. TCP Connect Scan (-sT) The TCP Connect Scan performs the complete TCP handshake.\n1nmap -sT 192.168.1.1 When to use:\nWhen root privileges are not available For more accurate results on certain systems 3. UDP Scan (-sU) UDP scanning is important for services such as DNS, SNMP, and DHCP.\n1nmap -sU 192.168.1.1 **Special features:**nmap-help aufrufen\nSlower than TCP scans More difficult to interpret Important for complete security assessment Operating system detection Nmap can detect remote operating systems through TCP/IP stack fingerprinting.\n1nmap -O 192.168.1.1 How it works:\nSends TCP and UDP packets to the target system Analyzes virtually every bit in the responses Compares results with a database of over 2,600 OS fingerprints Advanced OS detection: 1nmap -O --osscan-guess 192.168.1.1 # Aggressive detection 2nmap -O --osscan-limit 192.168.1.1 # Only for good targets Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) The Nmap Scripting Engine is one of the most powerful features of Nmap. It allows you to use Lua scripts for advanced tasks.\nScript categories: auth - Authentication scripts broadcast - Broadcast scripts default - Default scripts discovery - Discovery scripts dos - Denial of service scripts exploit - Exploit scripts fuzzer - Fuzzing scripts intrusive - Intrusive scripts malware - Malware detection safe - Safe scripts version - Version detection vuln - Vulnerability scripts NSE examples: 1nmap -sC 192.168.1.1 # Standard scripts 2nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.1 # Vulnerability scripts 3nmap --script http-* 192.168.1.1 # All HTTP scripts 4nmap --script smb-vuln-* 192.168.1.1 # SMB vulnerability scripts Timing templates Nmap offers 6 timing templates for different speed and stealth requirements:\nTemplate Name Description Usage -T0 Paranoid Very slow (5 min delay) IDS bypass -T1 Sneaky Slow (15 sec delay) IDS bypass -T2 Polite Polite (0.4 sec delay) Resource conservation -T3 Normal Standard (parallel) Standard -T4 Aggressive Fast Modern, reliable networks -T5 Insane Very fast Local networks, may be inaccurate Recommendations for IT security: Internal audits: -T4 for fast results **External penetration tests: -T2 or -T3 for less conspicuousness **Stealth assessments: -T0 or -T1 Output formats Nmap supports various output formats for different purposes:\nNormal output (-oN) 1nmap -oN scan_results.txt 192.168.1.0/24 Standard text format Easy to read for humans Ideal for individual hosts or small networks XML output (-oX) 1nmap -oX scan_results.xml 192.168.1.0/24 Structured, machine-readable format Ideal for automation and databases Can be converted to HTML Grepable Output (-oG) 1nmap -oG scan_results.grep 192.168.1.0/24 Optimized for Unix tools such as grep, awk, cut One host per line Ideal for scripting All formats (-oA) 1nmap -oA complete_scan 192.168.1.0/24 Creates .nmap, .xml, and .grep files simultaneously Practical use cases for IT security managers 1. Network discovery 1# Find active hosts on the network 2nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 3# Detailed host information 4nmap -A 192.168.1.0/24 2.

When analyzing the security of an operating system, it is of course important to know which connections the operating system or installed software establishes to services on the Internet. Furthermore, malware can also be quickly detected by displaying listening ports. The netstat command can be used to list these connections and listening ports.\nWhat can I do with the netstat command? You can also use the information obtained in this way to analyze connection problems caused by your firewall, server instance, or UTM. This is because even legitimate programs need a connection to the Internet for various services but are blocked by your software or hardware firewall, for example.\nWhen assessing the security of a system, it is important to know that most attacks on a system are carried out by creating a reverse shell. Since most standard firewalls only monitor traffic/requests from the outside to the inside and generally trust connections from the inside to the outside, attacks via a reverse shell are one of the most commonly used attack scenarios.\nHow does netstat work? To use netstat, you must first open the command line or start a Powershell instance.\nOpen the command line: You can open the command line by pressing the Windows key + s in Windows, entering “cmd**” in the search field, then right-clicking with the mouse pointer on the “Command Prompt” selection and selecting “Run as administrator**.”\nOpen Powershell: To open the Powershell console, use the key combination Windows key + s, enter “powershell,” and then right-click and select “Run Powershell as administrator.”\nOverview of netstat functions You can get an overview of the functions and parameters of netstat by entering the following command in the console window:\n1netstat help netstat help\nThe overview now shows the available functions and parameters that can be combined with netstat. The parameters can also be combined with each other.\nDisplay active connections After opening your console, you can display all active connections on your computer by entering the command\n1netstat -a to display all active connections on your computer.\nnetstat windows\nThe table view is divided into four columns.\nProtocol The first column shows the protocol used for the connection.\nLocal IP address The second column shows the locally used IP address and the port used, where the address 127.0.0.1 stands for local processes (on the same computer) that listen for internal connections and exclude external connections (Internet and other external networks).\nThe IP address 0.0.0.0 in conjunction with a displayed port listens for all requests from all network interfaces and accepts these connections.\nRemote IP address The third column shows the IP address and port used by the remote address.\nStatus Finally, the fourth column shows the current status of this connection. This status is displayed in the states “LISTENING, WAITING, ESTABLISHED, and CLOSE_WAITING.”\nDisplay routing tables It is equally important to be able to track the routing of IP packets. The following command allows you to display the configured routing table.\n1netstat -r This gives you an overview of which subnets IP packets can be routed to, for example, from the subnet used by your computer to other subnets (e.g., other subdomains, Internet gateway, etc.).\nDisplay network interfaces Here you can display the individual network interfaces available on your Windows device and, for example, whether and which interface is active (status). To display the information described above, use this command.\n1netstat -i Overview: netstat commands in Windows Command Description netstat Displays all active TCP connections netstat -a Displays all active TCP connections and the TCP/UDP ports on which the computer is listening netstat -n Displays connections with numeric IP addresses and ports without name resolution netstat -o Displays active TCP connections including process ID (PID) netstat -e Displays Ethernet statistics such as bytes and packets sent/received netstat -s Displays statistics per protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP) netstat -p Displays connections for the specified protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP) netstat -r Displays the routing table (similar to “route print”) netstat -b Displays outgoing/incoming connections and associated programs/file paths netstat -f Displays full domain names for foreign addresses netstat -x Displays NetworkDirect connections (Windows-specific) netstat -q Displays listening and non-listening ports netstat -t Displays the offload status of current connections netstat -y Displays connection template information netstat /? Displays all available parameters and a help overview netstat [interval] Repeats the display at the specified interval in seconds (e.g., netstat -n 5) Many parameters can be combined, e.g. netstat -ano shows all connections with PID and without name resolution.\nSome options are specific to certain protocols or network environments; for details, refer to the help page (netstat /?).\nQuestions and answers If you have any questions or feedback about this blog or YouTube channel, please use my help page.

Those of you who have been following my blog or YouTube channel for a while will notice that, apart from the visual appearance, a few other things have changed. I would like to briefly introduce and summarize all the changes here.\nWhy a different design? As you can undoubtedly see, the blog has a new design. This is because I have separated from my old CMS ‘WordPress’ and have now switched to a static website, which I run with the content generator Hugo.io.\nThere were several reasons for switching to a static website:\nNo PHP backend Quick overview for interested parties (customers) of the skills I have to offer Faster loading times Greater security Restructuring of the website More privacy for you Where has the community forum gone? Some of you will have noticed, at the latest when you landed on the 404 page, that the community forum no longer exists in its old form.\nWhy is the community forum no longer available? There are several reasons for this, which I would like to share with you.\nIn my opinion, the forum plugin we were using was not as good as we had hoped and caused me more and more work due to errors, which was not exactly confidence-inspiring in my eyes. For example, the media files were not backed up during regular backups of the WordPress site and could not be restored when we moved to a new server. Furthermore, I think that errors during the login/registration process in the community forum meant that many of you simply didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like continuing to use the forum. Will there be another community forum? At the moment, there are no plans to bring back a forum of this kind on this blog.\nHowever, there will still be a place for all of you who are interested to exchange ideas in a different form. For this purpose, I am using a self-hosted ticket system ( Zammad ) which also offers a Q\u0026amp;A page where you can publicly ask questions and find the answers you are looking for. Here you also have the option of creating your own tickets via email or web form, and the answers to the questions will then be published in anonymized form. This also makes life easier for me, as I don\u0026rsquo;t have to answer some questions ten times ;) .\nWhere has the comment function gone? At the moment, I haven\u0026rsquo;t found a privacy-friendly comment solution for a static website that meets my requirements in terms of functionality and privacy.\nThe disadvantage of a static website is that there is no backend for storing content and therefore no built-in comment function is available. If I find something acceptable in the future, I will implement this feature again.\nFeel free to send me your suggestions!\nAnd what about the newsletter? As already explained in the question about the comment function, the situation is similar with a newsletter solution. In the past, I used a self-hosted solution as a newsletter backend to ensure as much privacy as possible for you. Unfortunately, I haven\u0026rsquo;t found a suitable solution for this yet.\nHere, too, I am open to suggestions from you!\nThe future\u0026hellip; I really hope that this website will continue to offer you added value and help you answer your questions, assist you with your projects, or remain a good place to go for more information on my YouTube videos.\nIn any case, I hope you continue to enjoy visiting this blog and that my tutorials are helpful to you!\nYou can find the “Q \u0026amp; A page” here: The Q \u0026amp; A PAGE\n","date":"July 26, 2025","hero":"/images/posts/info/logo_blau.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/info/information/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"what-happened-here\"\u003eWhat happened here?!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose of you who have been following my blog or YouTube channel for a while will notice that, apart from the visual appearance, a few other things have changed.\nI would like to briefly introduce and summarize all the changes here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-a-different-design\"\u003eWhy a different design?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can undoubtedly see, the blog has a new design.

In this article, I would like to give you a closer look at how a Unified Threat Management (UTM or UTM firewall) works and explain the individual functions and technical terms.\nWhat is the difference between a UTM firewall and a normal firewall? There is a clear definition of this term, which specifies the designation of a security component (security appliance). For example, a pure firewall is referred to as a Specialized Security Appliance (SSA), as this network security component performs a clearly defined task in the security system. In this case, it is to prevent network connections according to a defined set of rules. UTMA / UTM refers to security network components that combine several security components (Specialized Security Appliances (SSA)) of a network. You can find out what these are in the next paragraph.\nWhat does a unified threat management system include? A network security system that can be called a UTM must have several features or functions. This range of functions was defined by Charles Kolodgy of the International Data Corporation in 2004. This definition specifies the features that a unified threat management appliance (UTMA) must include.\nUnified Threat Management – Features and functions: Internet gateway Firewall Virtual Private Network Gateway (VPN) Virus protection Intrusion Detection System Content filter Spam protection Surf protection Authentication Quality of Service (QoS) Reporting Intrusion detection and intrusion protection systems explained What is an intrusion detection system? An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an attack detection system that uses filters and signatures as well as static analysis to detect and log attacks on the network. Unlike an intrusion prevention system (IPS), an intrusion detection system only detects attacks on a computer network and logs them.\nAs already mentioned, an intrusion prevention system (IPS) not only detects and logs attacks on the network, but also defends against or blocks them. Since both systems work on the basis of filters and signatures, the use of such a network security system is very resource-intensive and requires powerful hardware depending on the size of the data volumes to be processed. Furthermore, there are also two system variants that not only perform their tasks using filters and signature rules, but also check unknown attacks using heuristic methods. In most unified threat management systems, the IPS or IDS systems are activated manually by the administrator and the filters are administered.\nThere are three common types of IDS systems: Hybrid IDS systems Network-based IDS systems (NIDS) Host-based IDS systems (HIDS) Surf protection / web content filter Another feature that a UTM firewall must provide according to the definition of a unified threat management appliance is the functionality of so-called surf protection or a web content filter.\nSimple content filter Here, content is filtered according to surfing protection rules when Internet requests are made. This filtering takes place in various ways. In simple terms, character strings are checked in advance, usually via a web proxy (in the case of a central network content filter), using specific character filters (sex, hate, etc.) and only passed on to the respective client after a successful non-positive check. Certain ports can also be blocked. One disadvantage of this method is that content containing part of these character strings in their character string is also blocked. For example, the filter word “law” also blocks content such as law studies.\nIntelligent content filter Intelligent content filters are characterized by the fact that they achieve a better hit rate using heuristics and weighting. For example, plausibility checks are used to weigh up whether the content to be searched is a website that can be blocked. Here, a distinction is made between right-wing extremist sites (their content) and sites about law, for example. Some UTMA systems also use artificial intelligence-supported processes or offer them as add-on applications. Further links on this topic: Content filter – Wikipedia\nInternet gateway An internet gateway is the interface that enables the internal network to connect to the internet. Some systems (UTM firewalls) offer modem functionality for various types of internet connections to replace service provider routers.\nVirtual Private Network Gateway (VPN) A secure virtual private network connection is essential for securely connecting remote workstations to the company network, for example, or for securely controlling your smart home infrastructure at home. This purely software-based technology uses a virtual network area to integrate a remote network into your existing network. It should be noted that this VPN connection is not inherently encrypted. Encryption is only provided by the use of various VPN protocols, which ensure a tap-proof connection between the VPN gateway of your Unified Threat Management firewall and the client or other VPN gateway.\nMost commonly used VPN protocols for unified threat management firewalls: SSL VPN IPsec TLS/SSL SSH Wireguard SSTP L2TP getVPN Authentication UTM firewall A Unified Threat Management / UTM firewall also includes an authentication feature. This feature allows users to authenticate themselves to the system or the service being used, providing an additional layer of security so that only known clients can connect to the gateway via a VPN connection, for example. Depending on the manufacturer, various authentication services are available.\nHere is a selection of authentication services: Radius server Database-based authentication LDAP authentication Active Directory Virus protection Virus protection in a Unified Threat Management System refers to an antivirus security solution that is permanently implemented in the UTM firewall and checks data blocks for malicious code using signatures. Open source firewalls such as OPNSense, IPFire, or pfsense use ClamAV as their antivirus solution. Firewall distributions from paid providers often use their own scan engine or solutions from well-known antivirus manufacturers. For example, the manufacturer Sophos uses its own antivirus solution engine in its Sophos UTM product and the engine from Avira as an additional scanning solution.\n","date":"July 25, 2025","hero":"/images/posts/it-security/UTM-Diagramm.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/security/what-is-a-unified-threat-management-firewall/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"unified-threat-management-appliances-utm-firewall\"\u003eUnified Threat Management Appliances (UTM Firewall)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my article “How does a firewall work?” (\u003ca href=\"https://secure-bits.org/wie-funktioniert-eine-firewall/%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehttps://secure-bits.org/wie-funktioniert-eine-firewall/)\u003c/a\u003e, I described how a firewall is structured and the differences between the various types of firewalls.\nIn this article, I would like to give you a closer look at how a Unified Threat Management (UTM or UTM firewall) works and explain the individual functions and technical terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-the-difference-between-a-utm-firewall-and-a-normal-firewall\"\u003eWhat is the difference between a UTM firewall and a normal firewall?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a clear definition of this term, which specifies the designation of a security component (security appliance).

The fastest way to access the search field is by pressing the Windows key + R.\nipconfig /all To get an overview of the physical addresses, the IP addresses used, the DHCP server, and the DNS server used for the individual network adapters, use the command ipconfig /all. ipconfig /flushdns This command clears the DNS resolution cache. This function is useful if, for example, there are problems with DNS resolution because the DNS server settings have been changed. This command initiates a new query of the DNS server settings. ipconfig /renew The command ipconfig /renew is used for IPv4 address ranges and the command ipconfig /renew6 for IPv6 address ranges to request a new IP address for the network adapters connected via the TCP/IP protocol. ipconfig /displaydns This command is used to display the contents of the DNS resolution cache. Addressing network adapters Most ipconfig commands also allow you to address individual network adapters directly. To do this, append the name of the network adapter to the basic command after the actual ipconfig command (example: ipconfig /renew Name\\_Network adapter). If there are multiple network adapters, they can also be limited by adding \\*Net\\ (executes the command on all network adapters that have “Net” in their name) or Ne\\* (executes the command on all network adapters that begin with “Ne” in their name).

New videos on the topic are added here regularly.\nTo the playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLknVEQKqt1ln-5HL8aG_Xk0bDeitgt0j_\nHowTo – Securing Linux SSH access correctly SSH is a popular protocol for logging into remote servers and executing commands. But how can you ensure that only authorized persons have access to the SSH service? In this tutorial, I would like to share some tips and tricks on how to properly secure your SSH access.\nStep 1 Secure Linux SSH – Change the default port of the SSH service Most attacks on the SSH port (port 22) are automated. Therefore, changing the SSH port can make this method of attack a little more difficult. I will show you how to change the default SSH port.\nTo change the default SSH port, you need to modify it in the SSH service\u0026rsquo;s configuration file.\nTo do this, open the configuration file located at ‘/etc/ssh/sshd_config’ with the ‘Nano’ editor, as shown in this example.\nIMPORTANT! Adjust firewall rules!\nIf you have already activated firewall rules on your server, you must add this rule to your selected port! Otherwise, you will lock yourself out and no longer have access via SSH!\n1# Open the SSH config file 2sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config After calling up the above command, an editor window should open with the following content:\nLinux file sshd_config\nIn the line ‘#Port 22’, remove the # sign (this activates the function/destinations) and replace the default port number with your chosen port number. In this case, it is Port 2223. Now save the change with the key combination ‘CTRL+O’ and exit the editor with ‘CTRL+X’.\nThe SSH service must be restarted for the changes to take effect.\n1# Restart SSH service 2 3sudo systemctl restart ssh 4 5# Check status and port of SSH service 6 7sudo systemctl status ssh 8 9# It should now show that the service is ‘enabled’ and the listening port is specified further down in the output. Checking the possibility of an SSH login on the new port To do this, open a new terminal window and log in to the server via SSH, specifying the new port.\n1# Login SSH with port specification 2ssh root@IP address -p 2223 3# The port and IP address must be supplemented with your corresponding and selected information. Changed SSH port not accessible\nIf the SSH port change does not work, i.e., SSH access is not accessible via the new port, please enter the following commands. This error can occur, for example, with a Debian Proxmox container. Here, the port change in sshd_config is not automatically applied and access via the standard port 22 is still possible.\n1systemctl disable ssh.socket 2systemctl stop ssh.socket 3reboot A list of standardized and dynamic ports can be found, for example, here in the corresponding Wikipedia post:\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_standardisierten_Ports\nStep 2 Secure Linux SSH – Generate SSH key pair \u0026#x26a0;\u0026#xfe0f; IMPORTANT NOTE!\nFirst of all, please note that you should only use the two methods RSA 4096 bit (3072 bit or higher) and Ed25519 for key generation. I personally always use Ed25519 (based on an elliptic curve) together with an extra passphrase (additional password) as a second factor and would recommend doing the same.\nGenerate SSH key pair on Linux and macOS Open a terminal window and enter the following command to create and protect a key file using Ed25519 with an additional password and additional protection against brute force attacks.\n1# Create a key pair based on Ed25519 + password and brute force protection 2ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 3# Output: 4Generating public/private ed25519 key pair. 5Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_ed25519): 6Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): (enter your desired password here) 7Enter same passphrase again: (repeat the password here) 8 9# The key pair is then generated and can be found via the path ‘/root/.ssh/id_ed25519’ for the private key and ‘/root/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub’ for the public key. \u0026#x26a0;\u0026#xfe0f; IMPORTANT NOTE!\nThe key with the extension id_ed25519 is the private key and must never be disclosed!\nPlease keep the private key safe and store it in the password manager ‘Bitwarden’, for example, or save it to an encrypted USB stick and keep it safe. Without this private key, you will no longer have access to your server if it is lost!\nOnly the key file with the extension .pub should be used for exporting!!!\nGenerating an SSH key pair in Windows Starting with Windows 10 version 1809, an SSH client is installed by default, so you can start generating keys right away.\nTo do this, enter the following command in the command line in PowerShell or Microsoft Terminal (which I always use in the videos) with administrator rights:\n1# Create a key pair based on Ed25519 + password and brute force protection on Windows 2ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 3# Output: 4Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \u0026lt;enter your secure password here\u0026gt; 5Enter same passphrase again: \u0026lt;confirm password\u0026gt; 6Your identification has been saved in C:Usersusername/.ssh/id_ed25519. \u0026lt;username = replace with your username\u0026gt; 7Your public key has been saved in C:Usersusername/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub. \u0026lt;username = replace with your username\u0026gt; 8The key fingerprint is: 9Example: SHA256:OIzc1yE7joL2Bzy8!gS0j8eGK7bYaH1FmF3sDuMeSj8 username@LOCAL-HOSTNAME Step 3 Secure Linux SSH – Copy SSH public key to remote server In order to be able to log in to the Linux server with a key pair in the future, the public key must first be copied/communicated to the remote server.\nThis public key is stored for the user logging in in the file ‘.ssh/authorized_keys’. You can find this in the root directory ‘cd .ssh’.\nIf the directory ‘.ssh/’ does not exist, please create it on the remote server with the following command:\nmkdir .ssh/\nTo install the public key on the remote server, you must be authorized to log in to the remote server with your username and password! Copy the public key to the file ‘.ssh/authorized_keys’ in Windows PowerShell / Microsoft Terminal\nTo start copying the public key to the remote server, please enter the following command:\n1# Copy key to a remote server via Powershell 2type $env:USERPROFILE.sshid_ed25519.pub | ssh remoteuser@IP-addressRemote-Server “cat \u0026gt;\u0026gt; .ssh/authorized_keys” 3# Replace \u0026lt;remoteuser\u0026gt; with the user on the remote server you want to log in to. 4# Replace \u0026lt;IP address of remote server\u0026gt; with the IP address of your remote server. Copy the public_key to the file ‘.ssh/authorized_keys’ on Linux / macOS\nTIP!\nIn order to install the public_key on the remote server, you must be authorized to log in to the remote server with your username and password!\nTo copy the public_key to the remote server under Linux and macOS (which is also based on a Unix system), open a terminal window and enter the following command:\n1# The attribute -p specifies the SSH port of the remote server. 2ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_ed25519.pub -p 2223 remoteuser@IP-addressRemote-server Checking the authorized_keys on the remote server Last but not least, we must check the ‘authorized_keys’ file on the remote server to make sure that the public key has actually been added as an entry!\nTo do this, log in to the remote server with your username and password and call up the contents of the ‘authorized_keys’ file with the following command:\n1# Display the contents of the ‘authorized_keys’ file 2nano .ssh/authorized_keys 3# Output: 4The output of the editor window should look like this or start like this: 5ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3N........ Step 4 Secure Linux SSH – Enable SSH login via SSH key Once the public key has been successfully copied to the remote server and verified, we can now enable the login method via key pair on this server.\nTo do this, we will modify the config file ‘sshd_config’ accordingly.\n1# Adjust the SSH configuration file on the remote server 2# Open sshd-config 3sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 4# Now set the following line to ‘Yes’ in the editor window and remove the # sign 5PubkeyAuthentication yes 6# Furthermore, you must check whether the correct path to the file ‘authorized_keys’ is specified and also activated. 7# To do this, the line for this file must look as follows and the ‘#’ character must be removed: 8AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys 9# Then save the file with ‘CTRL+O’ and exit the editor window with ‘CTRL+X’. After making these changes to ‘sshd_config’, the SSH service must be restarted:\n1# Restart the SSH service to apply the changes 2sudo systemctl restart ssh 3# For Red Hat-based distributions such as CentOS, Fedora, Rocky Linux, etc., restart the ‘sshd’ service. 4sudo service sshd restart Step 5 Secure Linux SSH – Verify SSH login with key pair To verify SSH access via SSH key, log in to the remote server as usual:\n1# Log in to the ### Schritt 7 Linux SSH absichern – Anmeldung als Root-User via SSH deaktivieren 2 3Ein wirklich wichtiger Sicherheitsaspekt bei der Absicherung des SSH-Zugangs ist es, dass der volle root-Zugang via SSH-Zugang deaktiviert wird! Dieses gilt nicht nur für die Anmeldung via SSH-Schlüssel auf dem Remote-Server wie wir es in diesem Tutorial gelernt haben, sondern sollte immer in der ’sshd_config-Datei‘ deaktiviert werden. 4 5Ein fremder Nutzer der sich mit zum Beispiel gestohlenen Anmeldedaten auf eurem Server via SSH anmelden kann und dann gleich alles Privilegien für Änderungen hat, ist der absolute Alptraum! 6 7Um diesen Alptraum zu vermeiden, öffnen wir wieder die Konfigurationsdatei für den SSH-Dienst und passen diese wie folgt an: 8```bash 9# Anmeldung als Root-User via SSH-Verbindung deaktivieren 10sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 11# Im Editor-Fenster nun die Zeile \u0026#39;#PermitRootLogin\u0026#39; in \u0026#39;PermitRootLogin no\u0026#39; ändern 12# Dann wieder die Änderungen speichern und den SSH-Dienst neustarten 13sudo systemctl restart ssh Schritt 8 Linux SSH absichern – Neueste Protokolle zur Authentifizierung erzwingen Ein weiterer Schritt um die Sicherheit der SSH-Anmeldung zu erhöhen ist es, die Erzwingung der Nutzung der neuesten Protokolle (SSH-Protocol-Version 2) zur Anmeldung zu nutzen.\nHierfür muss natürlich wieder die SSH-Config-Datei angepasst werden und der SSH-Dienst neu gestartet werden.\n1# Folgende Einträge sollten in der SSH-Config-Datei noch hinzugefügt bzw. angepasst werden. 2ChallengeResponseAuthentication no 3# und 4UsePAM no 5# Dann wieder den SSH-Dienst neu starten 6sudo systemctl restart ssh Fazit – Linux SSH absichern Wir haben in diesem Tutorial gelernt, wie wir den SSH-Zugang zu einem Linux-Server effektiv und nach neustem Stand der Technik vor Angriffe schützen können.\nIch kann nur jedem ans Herz legen, alle SSH-Zugänge (auch im internen Netzwerk) so abzusichern! Weiterhin habt ihr noch die Möglichkeit Brute Force-Attacken auf den SSH-Service mit zum Beispiel ‚Fail2ban‘ zu schützen. Wie das funktioniert, habe ich euch ja schon in dem Tutorial ‚Raspberry Pi absichern von A-Z | 2023‚ (funktioniert bei allen debian-basierten Systemen) gezeigt und habe auf eine Wiederholung in diesem Tutorial darauf verzichtet.\nWichtig ist noch zu erwähnen, dass diese in diesem Tutorial behandelte Methode nur eine Möglichkeit widerspiegelt, einen Linux-Server richtig abzusichern. Also nur ein Baustein in der IT-Sicherheit ist!\nSollte euch dieses Tutorial ein wenig gefallen haben, so würde ich mich über ein Abo von meinem YouTube-Kanal sehr freuen! remote server via SSH key ssh user@IP addressRemoteServer\nIf you are logging in to the remote server with this user for the first time, you will receive the following query: The authenticity of host ‘IP address of remote server’ can\u0026rsquo;t be established. ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:ElsjpajVayeK. This key is not known by any other names Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\nHere you must confirm with ‘yes’ and then enter the passphrase (your password for the SSH key created above) Enter passphrase for key ‘C:Usersmarcel/.ssh/id_ed25519’: You should now be connected to the remote server 1--- 2### Step 6 Secure Linux SSH – Secure Linux SSH by disabling password login 3\u0026gt; **ATTENTION!** 4\u0026gt; 5\u0026gt;Only perform this step if the login via SSH key worked and you have created another user with elevated privileges as described in the article ‘Securing Raspberry Pi from A to Z’! 6\u0026gt; 7\u0026gt; **Otherwise, you will lock yourself out of the server!** 8--- 9 10After successfully logging in with the SSH key, we can now finally disable the insecure password login to the remote server. 11 12To do this, we need to make another adjustment to the ‘sshd_config’ file and, at the same time, disable the ‘root user’ login as described in the next section. 13```bash 14# Disable SSH login using passwords on the remote server 15sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config # Open the sshd_config file for editing 16# Change the following line ‘#PasswordAuthentication yes’ to ‘PasswordAuthentication no’ 17# Save with ‘CTRL+O’ and exit the editor with \u0026#39;CTRL+X\u0026#39; 18# Restart the SSH service 19sudo systemctl restart ssh Of course, you can make the changes from the next paragraph in this tutorial at the same time, but for clarity, I will perform all steps individually!\nStep 7 Secure Linux SSH – Disable root user login via SSH A really important security aspect when securing SSH access is to disable full root access via SSH! This applies not only to logging in via SSH key on the remote server, as we learned in this tutorial, but should always be disabled in the ‘sshd_config file’.\nAn unknown user who can log in to your server via SSH with stolen login credentials, for example, and then immediately has full privileges to make changes is an absolute nightmare!\nTo avoid this nightmare, we open the configuration file for the SSH service again and adjust it as follows:\n1# Disable login as root user via SSH connection 2sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 3# In the editor window, change the line ‘#PermitRootLogin’ to \u0026#39;PermitRootLogin no\u0026#39; 4# Then save the changes again and restart the SSH service 5sudo systemctl restart ssh Step 8 Secure Linux SSH – Enforce the latest authentication protocols Another step to increase the security of SSH login is to enforce the use of the latest protocols (SSH Protocol Version 2) for login.\nTo do this, you must again modify the SSH config file and restart the SSH service.\n1# The following entries should be added or modified in the SSH config file. 2ChallengeResponseAuthentication no 3# and 4UsePAM no 5# Then restart the SSH service again. 6sudo systemctl restart ssh Conclusion – Securing Linux SSH In this tutorial, we learned how to effectively protect SSH access to a Linux server from attacks using the latest technology.\nI highly recommend securing all SSH access (including on the internal network) in this way! You also have the option of protecting the SSH service against brute force attacks with, for example, ‘Fail2ban’. I have already shown you how this works in the tutorial ‘Securing Raspberry Pi from A to Z | 2023’ (works on all Debian-based systems) and have refrained from repeating it in this tutorial.\nIt is important to mention that the method covered in this tutorial is only one way to properly secure a Linux server. It is only one component of IT security!\nIf you enjoyed this tutorial, I would be very happy if you subscribed to my YouTube channel!\n","date":"February 18, 2025","hero":"/images/posts/linux-ssh/SSH-absichern.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/linux/linux-ssh-absichern/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"securing-linux-ssh-access-correctly\"\u003eSecuring Linux SSH access correctly\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen operating a Linux server, it is usually necessary for administration purposes to establish secure access via SSH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis tutorial is designed to help you successfully protect Linux SSH access against attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, securing SSH access is only one way of protecting your server against attacks.

In this short tutorial, I will show you how to use fail2ban to secure access to the ‘SSH’ service and port ‘8006’ of the dashboard. Starting point In this scenario, we are dealing with a Proxmox server that is hosted as a dedicated server at Hetzner and can be reached via the public Internet using an IPv4 and IPv6 address. In general, the use of fail2ban should only be considered as part of a set of security measures to secure your server. Feel free to consult further security measures here on my blog.\nVoucher\nIf you would also like to operate a VPS/root/dedicated server, I can offer you a 20 euro voucher. To use this voucher, click on the link below. The 20 euro voucher can only be used for new registrations on the Hetzner website!\nLink to the voucher: https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=OBFauh7A1Ru8\nInstalling fail2ban on Debian 12 IMPORTANT NOTE!\nPlease note that all commands executed below require elevated privileges!\nYou can obtain these rights by executing the following command once for the existing SSH session:\nsudo -s\nSince Proxmox VE is based on the Debian distribution, fail2ban is installed in the same way as a classic Debian installation. There are two ways to set up fail2ban on the Proxmox system.\nSetup via the Proxmox dashboard. To set up via the Proxmox dashboard, click on the Proxmox node, select “Shell,” and then enter the appropriate configuration information.\nSetup via terminal using an SSH connection to the Proxmox server. In my example, we will connect to the Proxmox server via a terminal using SSH. The advantage of this is greater convenience, e.g. when using copy \u0026amp; paste. To set up via the Proxmox dashboard, click on the Proxmox node, select ‘Shell’ and then enter the relevant information for the configuration.\nSSH connection via terminal with the Proxmox server First, we establish a connection via SSH with the Proxmox server. Depending on your operating system, you can use a terminal window, Putty, or similar.\n1# Establish SSH connection 2ssh root@\u0026lt;IP address of Proxmox server\u0026gt; Update the operating system and install fail2ban 1# Update the system 2sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt upgrade -y 3# Install fail2ban 4sudo apt install fail2ban Adjust the fail2ban configuration for Proxmox VE As described in the introduction to this tutorial, we want to protect the standard SSH port (22) and port 8006 for the Proxmox VE dashboard interface from brute force attacks. First, we create a local jail config file in the fail2ban directory, in which we then store the adjustments for our project.\n1# First, we will 2# call up the fail2ban directory, where the future and other configuration files are located 3cd /etc/fail2ban 4# Create the configuration file for fail2ban 5nano jail.conf In the next step, we add the configuration for securing the SSH connection and securing port 8006.\n1# Configuration for fail2ban – securing SSH (standard port 22) and Proxmox dashboard access (port 8006) 2# Default settings for fail2ban 3 4[DEFAULT] 5allowipv6 = auto 6bantime = 3600 7backend = systemd 8ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 9 10# Config for SSH 11 12[sshd] 13mode = aggressive 14port = ssh 15logpath = %(sshd_log)s 16banaction = nftables-multiport 17banaction_allports = nftables-allports 18backend = systemd 19enabled = true 20maxretry = 2 21findtime = 3600 22bantime = 3h 23 24# Config for Proxmox 25 26[proxmox] 27enabled = true 28port = https,http,8006 29filter = proxmox 30backend = systemd 31maxretry = 3 32findtime = 3600 33bantime = 3h Now save the configuration file ‘jail-local’ with CTRL + O and close the Nano editor with CTRL + X.\nIgnore IP\nUnder ‘ignoreip’, you can add IP addresses and subnets as exceptions to prevent yourself from being locked out, for example.\nCreate Proxmox filter for fail2ban A filter configuration for SSH is included in fail2ban by default. We first need to create the filter configuration for Proxmox. To do this, we switch to the directory ‘/etc/fail2ban/filter.d’ and create the filter configuration for Proxmox with ‘nano proxmox.conf’.\n1# Filter configuration proxmox 2[Definition] 3failregex = pvedaemon\\[.*authentication failure; rhost=\u0026lt;HOST\u0026gt; user=.* msg=.* 4ignoreregex = 5journalmatch = _SYSTEMD_UNIT=pvedaemon.service Save this file with CTRL + O and exit the editor with CTRL + X.\nStart and check the fail2ban service Now that we have created the necessary configuration files, we can proceed and start fail2ban on the system.\n1# Enable fail2ban autostart, start service 2systemctl enable fail2ban 3systemctl start fail2ban 4# Check fail2ban status 5systemctl status fail2ban The output should then look something like this:\nHere are a few commands that allow you to ‘control’ fail2ban.\nDisplay the banned IP addresses 1# Banned IP addresses for SSH 2fail2ban-client status sshd 3# Banned IP addresses for Proxmox 4fail2ban-client status proxmox Here is an example output of the banned IP addresses that have attempted to log in via SSH.\nRemove banned IP address from the jail list 1# Remove IP address from the list of banned IP addresses 2# For SSH 3fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip \u0026lt;IP address\u0026gt; 4# For Proxmox 5fail2ban-client set proxmox unbanip \u0026lt;IP address\u0026gt; Conclusion – Securing Proxmox VE with fail2ban As seen in this tutorial, securing a Proxmox server against brute force attacks is actually quite trivial and, once in operation, provides very good protection. Furthermore, fail2ban can also be used to secure other services such as nginx, apache2, your own Bitwarden instance, etc., or you can create your own filter configuration as done in this tutorial for Proxmox.\nMy personal opinion on fail2ban\nFor me personally, using fail2ban to secure a server instance is a clear “must” and, when used in conjunction with the security layer principle, ensures the secure operation of public services.\nAlternative to fail2ban An alternative to fail2ban is offered by the application ‘crowdsec’. Crowdsec works in principle the same as fail2ban, but is supplemented by centrally managed dynamic lists. The disadvantage here, however, is that a public connection to this service is established. Further information on ‘crowdsec’ can be found here:\nhttps://www.crowdsec.net/\nI hope this tutorial is useful for some of you and helps you secure your Proxmox server instance!

Further information on support for individual PHP versions can be found here: https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php Therefore, I thought I would create a new and updated tutorial (my last one was from 2022) so that the PHP installation used is always provided with the latest security updates. I will also show you how to install and set up a firewall for the Raspberry Pi. And how to automatically update the system with new updates.\nVideo on the topic ‘Installing Pihole in 2024’ As usual, I have also published a video tutorial on this topic on my YouTube channel. Feel free to check it out and subscribe.\nInstalling Pihole on a Raspberry Pi First, here is a list of the requirements we need for the installation:\nRaspberry Pi with power supply, SD card, and case SD card reader SD card with adapter The ‘Raspberry Pi Imager’ software Installing Raspberry Pi Imager First, we need to provide our Raspberry Pi with a current Raspberry Pi OS, so the first step is to write the Raspberry Pi OS image to an SD card using the Raspberry Pi Imager.\nDownload Raspberry Pi OS Imager\nAfter downloading the latest Raspberry Pi Imager, you can easily install the application on your system. The Imager is available for Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, or can be installed on an existing Raspberry Pi OS with the following command.\n1# Install Raspberry Pi Imager on Raspberry Pi OS (I have not tested this yet) 2sudo apt install rpi-imager Write Raspberry Pi OS to the SD card The GIF below shows the configuration of the Raspberry Pi Imager for a Raspberry Pi OS on a Raspberry Pi 3. Always select the Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit lite version for writing to the SD card! This will install a minimal version of the OS, which is sufficient for running Pihole.\nA little tip for Raspberry Pi 3B models If you want to install Debian 12 “bookworm” with PHP 8.2 included on your Raspberry Pi 3B, please select Raspberry Pi 4 under ‘Raspberry Pi model’. Here you can then select Raspberry OS based on Debian 12. According to Raspberry Pi, Debian 12 is compatible with model 3B, and I can confirm this.\nWhen selecting the model, only Debian version 11 “bullseye” is listed under the Raspberry Pi 3B model.\nPlease note! Instead of SSH authentication via password, you should prefer login via key pair. You can also set this up after installation. For more information, see the article Securing Raspberry Pi from A to Z.\nGo to the tutorial Securing Raspberry Pi\nAfter completing the image writing of Raspberry Pi OS Once the SD card has been written, remove the card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi. After inserting the network cable into the Raspberry Pi and, in this example, into the Fritzbox, power up the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi will now boot up and after a short time, you will be able to see the device in the Fritzbox under Network Connections.\nConnecting to the Raspberry Pi via SSH To establish a connection with the Raspberry Pi, I am using Microsoft Terminal for the SSH connection in this example. Of course, you can also use Putty or, on macOS and Linux, the familiar terminal. To establish an SSH connection, we log in to the Raspberry Pi via SSH with the following commands.\n1# Command to establish the SSH connection 2sudo ssh username@IP address (from the Pi) 3# When connecting for the first time, you must accept the fingerprint. 4# Confirm this with ‘yes’ Update Raspberry Pi OS Before we can start installing PHP 8.3, we first need to update the Raspberry OS to the latest version. We do this with the following command.\n1# Check Raspberry OS for new packages 2sudo apt update 3# Update available packages and dependency changes 4sudo apt full-upgrade -y 5# The installation may take some time! 6# After the update is complete, the system must be restarted 7sudo reboot Important for PHP installation It is important that PHP 8.3 is installed before installing Pihole (especially on Debian 11), otherwise PHP 7.4 will be installed with the Pihole installation, which we want to avoid.\nPihole PHP | Installing PHP 8.3 on the Raspberry OS Now we can start installing PHP 8.3 on the Raspberry Pi. To do this, we first need to install a package and add a repository to the sources.list.\n1# Install required package 2sudo apt -y install lsb-release apt-transport-https ca-certificates 3# Install security key for the “Sury repository” 4sudo wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/php.gpg https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg 1# Install the package for PHP 8.3 2sudo echo “deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main” | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list 3# Update available packages 4sudo apt update 5# Install PHP 8.3 6sudo apt install php8.3 -y Installing sqlite3 for PHP 8.3 After installing PHP 8.3, we still need to install the additional module sqlite3 so that Pihole will work properly under PHP 8.3 later on. To install the PHP module ‘sqlite3’ on our Raspberry Pi OS, enter the following command in the Bash:\n1# Installation of the PHP module sqlite3 for running Pihole 2sudo apt install php8.3-sqlite3 Follow-up work after installing PHP 8.3 for Pihole Before we can continue with the installation of Pihole, we first need to get rid of the web server ‘apache2’ that was installed along with it. The reason for this is that Pihole uses the slim web server ‘lightptd’ for the admin web interface, so we do not need the Apache web server, which would also cause errors as it would already occupy port 80.\n1# Stop the Apache2 service 2sudo systemctl stop apache2 3# Uninstall Apache2 4sudo apt purge apache2 5# After uninstalling, the operating system must be restarted 6sudo reboot Pihole PHP | Installing Pihole with PHP 8.3 Note I have described the installation of Pihole on a Raspberry Pi in great detail in my other tutorial. Therefore, I will skip the individual steps here and refer you to my previous tutorial or to my video on this post here:\nInstalling Pihole on Raspberry Pi’\nMore videos and tutorials on Pihole I have published many other posts and videos on the topic of ‘Pihole’ here and on YouTube.

In this video, I show you step by step how to perform a manual update on a Linux-based AdGuard Home installation. The terminal commands required to ‘manually update AdGuard Home’ In this example, I will show you how to perform a manual update on Debian / Raspberry OS.\nPlease note Please adjust the path to your AdGuard Home installation directory according to your specific setup! The same applies to the corresponding AdGuardHome executable file.\nLogging in via SSH connection to our AdGuard Home instance Establish an SSH connection to your AdGuard Home host (Raspberry Pi, VM, etc.) via Terminal, Putty, or Windows Terminal (or PowerShell). In this example, I am using Windows Terminal on Windows 11. You can get this from the Microsoft App Store**, for example.\n1ssh user@IP address host 2# In my case 3ssh root@172.16.16.217 Update the host system Before we start updating AdGuard Home, we first update the host system on which AdGuard Home was installed.\n1# Update the host system on which AdGuard Home is running 2sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt upgrade -y Download the latest release of AdGuard Home The next step is to download the latest release of AdGuard Home. To do this, you need to find the download path on the AdGuard Home repository. To do this, visit the AdGuard Home project/download page and search for the appropriate entry/hyperlink in the table according to your host system/hardware. hardware in the table, then right-click on the corresponding link address in the context menu that opens and click on ‘Copy link address’ (see GIF image below). In my case, the host system is an x86 architecture and a Linux distribution\nOnce you have copied the link address, switch back to the terminal window, enter the command ‘wget+space’ and paste the link after the command using the key combination ‘CTRL+V’.\n1# Switch to the root directory 2cd 3# Download the latest release of AdGuard Home 4wget \u0026lt;insert link address of the latest AdGuard Home release\u0026gt; 5# In this example, use this link 6wget https://static.adguard.com/adguardhome/release/AdGuardHome_linux_386.tar.gz Unpack the AdGuard Home release file 1# Unpack the downloaded release file 2sudo tar xvf AdGuardHome_linux_386.tar.gz Stop the running AdGuard Home instance 1# Switch to the AdGuard directory.

This means that the commands listed here are not limited to the Raspberry Pi, but can also be used on all other Linux-based distros.\nIn keeping with the tutorial ‘Installing AdGuard on the Raspberry Pi’ (https://secure-bits.org/adguard-raspberry-pi-installation-2022/)', it makes sense to install the UFW firewall on the Raspberry Pi with AdGuard Home. This will protect the AdGuard DNS server from unauthorized access from the network.\nUFW firewall rules for AdGuard on the Raspberry Pi You can find the rules I suggest for the UFW firewall further down in this post. But first, make sure you read the whole post so you don\u0026rsquo;t lock yourself out of the Raspberry Pi. To the AdGuard rules\nWhat is a UFW firewall? The UFW firewall is not actually a firewall, but rather provides an interface to make it easier to configure the rule-based firewall ‘iptables’ via the terminal. The ‘iptables’ firewall is a component of every Linux-based distribution. With the UFW firewall, it is possible to create, change, or delete rules in ‘iptables’ using simple commands.\nIs there a graphical user interface for the UFW firewall? There is also a graphical user interface (GUI) for the UFW firewall. This graphical user interface is called ‘gufw’ and is pre-installed on Ubuntu systems. This extension is available for the following distributions:\nUbuntu Debian Linux Mint openSuse archlinux salix Note on the listed commands | UFW firewall Raspberry Pi All commands listed here work not only on a Raspberry Pi, but also on any other Linux-based distribution such as Ubuntu, Debian, archLinux, and many other systems.\nBasic instructions for handling a firewall rule With the UFW firewall, as well as other firewalls I am familiar with, there are three methods that regulate the processing of data packets in network traffic. Understanding these methods is the absolute basis for a secure firewall configuration.\nMethod ‘allow or pass’ With the ‘allow’ or ‘pass’ method, data packets are allowed during network requests. This method is usually the default for rules created for outgoing network traffic. Incoming network traffic is only explicitly allowed via ‘allow or pass’.\n‘reject’ method The ‘reject’ method, on the other hand, allows data packets in network traffic to be discarded and immediately sends feedback to the sender of the network request. Because the feedback about the rejected request to the sender is often misused for denial of service attacks, this method of handling requests is not particularly advantageous for a firewall and is therefore not used for this purpose. ‘reject’ is used, for example, in communication between network components to avoid a potentially high network load.\nMethod ‘deny or drop’ Unlike the ‘reject’ method, the ‘deny or drop’ method also rejects the network request immediately, but the sender does not receive any direct feedback and the requests are effectively ignored. However, the disadvantage of this method is that it can result in a higher network load. Nevertheless, this method of handling requests on a firewall is clearly preferable.\nInstalling the UFW firewall on Raspberry Pi To begin installing the UFW firewall, you must first connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH in the terminal window.\n1# Create an SSH connection to the Raspberry Pi 2ssh username@IP address of the Pi 3# For example: ssh pi@172.16.16.215 4# Then enter your assigned password. After successfully logging in, the contents of the terminal window should look like the following image.\nInstall UFW firewall on Raspberry Pi You can install the UFW firewall on the Raspberry Pi with the following command:\n1# Install ufw firewall 2sudo apt install ufw Activate UFW firewall service After installation, the firewall system service may need to be started.\n1# Start the UFW firewall system service 2sudo systemctl enable ufw --now Checking the firewall status - UFW firewall Raspberry Pi To check the status of the firewall, enter the following command:\n1# Query the firewall status 2sudo ufw status 3# Output: 4Status: inactive Important! Please do not activate the UFW firewall until the end of this tutorial, otherwise you will also lock yourself out of the Raspberry Pi!\nCreate basic incoming traffic prohibition rule - UFW firewall Raspberry Pi First, we will prohibit basic network traffic so that only explicit permissions created by us are active.\n1# Block basic network traffic 2sudo ufw default deny incoming Create basic outgoing rule - UFW firewall Raspberry Pi 1# Allow basic outgoing network traffic 2sudo ufw default allow outgoing 3# Of course, basic outgoing network traffic can also be blocked and individual ports can be enabled later 4sudo ufw default deny outgoing Create rule for access via ssh - UFW firewall Raspberry Pi To ensure that access to the Raspberry Pi via ssh is still possible after activating the UFW firewall, we create a rule for this.\n1# Create rule for ssh access. This can either be specified via ‘Port 22’ or you can select the ‘ssh’ service. A list of services recognized by the UFW firewall can be found at /etc/services 2sudo ufw allow ssh 3# Allow access only from your network 4sudo ufw allow from IP address range to any port 22 5# This is what the rule would look like for my network 6sudo ufw allow from 172.16.16.0/24 to any port 22 UFW firewall Limit login attempts for ssh To define a limit for ssh access and thus prevent a brute force attack (also works for other ports and services), you can create a rule that sets a limit on login attempts. With this limit, login attempts are restricted to 6 logins in 30 seconds. You can create this rule as follows:\n1# Set limit for login attempts on ssh port 2sudo ufw limit ssh 3or 4sudo ufw limit 22/tcp Known services of the UFW firewall The UFW firewall also recognizes some ‘services’ by default. Services include ‘ssh’ for port 22, for example.\nThese ‘services’ can also be addressed directly when creating new firewall rules. The image below shows the file in which the services of the UFW firewall are listed. You can view this file using the command ‘nano /etc/services’.\nDefining firewall rules using apps – UFW firewall Raspberry Pi Another method of defining the firewall rules is to use ‘App’ as a definition for handling data packets. ‘Apps’ are applications that are running on your system and, when installed, create and store so-called ‘profiles’, which specify the ports used by the application.\nDisplay a list of installed app profiles 1# Display UFW firewall app list 2sudo ufw app list 3# See the image below for an example output Display the app profile of an application in the UFW firewall As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the ports used by an application are specified in the app profile of an installed application. To display this profile, enter the following command in your terminal window.\n1# Display app profile 2sudo ufw app info \u0026lt;name of the app\u0026gt; 3# Example 4sudo ufw app info IMAPS 5# Output: See image below Define firewall rule using app profile To create a firewall rule using an app profile, enter the following command in the terminal.\n1# Define UFW firewall rule using app profile 2sudo ufw allow/deny APP profile 3# Example for IMAPS 4sudo ufw allow IMAPS Define your own firewall profiles - UFW firewall Raspberry Pi Of course, you also have the option of creating your own APP profiles (similar to the ‘alias’ in OPNsense) and assigning multiple ports to your own profile. Then, when creating rules for the UFW firewall, you only need to name this profile. These app profiles are saved under the following path: /etc/ufw/application.d/ In this example, I have named the profile I created ‘eigenesprofile’.\nCreate UFW firewall app profile 1# Change to the directory where the app profiles are stored 2cd /etc/ufw/application.d/ 3# Display the existing profiles (may look different depending on the apps you have installed) 4ls -l 5# Output 6pi@raspberrypi3:/etc/ufw/applications.d $ ls -l 7total 44 8-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 145 Jul 2 00:37 openssh-server 9-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 349 Dec 14 2018 ufw-bittorent 10-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 627 Mar 30 2018 ufw-chat 11-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 513 Mar 30 2018 ufw-directoryserver 12-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 89 Jan 14 2018 ufw-dnsserver 13-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 358 Mar 30 2018 ufw-fileserver 14-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 212 Jan 14 2018 ufw-loginserver 15-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 524 Mar 30 2018 ufw-mailserver 16-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 131 Jan 14 2018 ufw-printserver 17-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 155 Jan 14 2018 ufw-proxyserver 18-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 320 Jan 14 2018 ufw-webserver 19pi@raspberrypi3:/etc/ufw/applications.d $ 20# Create your own profile 21sudo nano ownprofile 22# In the Nano editor window, enter the following (adapted to your profile) 23[ownprofile] 24title=Ports for your own profile 25description=Ports and port ranges for your own app profile 26ports=443,80,3689/tcp 27# Save with CTRL+O and Enter, exit with CTRL+X 28# Load the new rule 29sudo ufw reload 30# Activate the rule you created 31sudo ufw allow ownprofile 32# Check the UFW firewall rules 33sudo ufw status verbose 34# Output see image below Checking the UFW firewall rules after creating your own profile Defining multiple ports as a rule If you want to create a firewall rule for several ports at the same time according to protocol definition (UDP or TCP), there are two options. The first option is to list the ports to be regulated with a ‘,’ (for example: 22,25,80,443). The second option is to specify port ranges using the ‘:’ character (for example: 2000:3000).

With this DNS server, similar to the pihole DNS server (click here for the tutorial), you can ban most ads and data trackers from your home network. If you still need hardware for your AdGuard DNS server, take a look at the end of this post. I\u0026rsquo;ve put together a short list there.\nVideo tutorial – AdGuard Raspberry Pi Home Installation If you\u0026rsquo;d prefer to watch the individual steps for ‘AdGuard Raspberry Pi Installation’ as a video tutorial, you can do so on my YouTube channel. Just click on the image below. Looking for an alternative to ‘AdGuard Home Raspberry Pi Installation’? Then take a look at my step-by-step guide on how to install the DNS server Pi-hole on a Raspberry PI. Go to tutorial\nNote! There was a typo in the command to unzip the file “sudo tar xvf AdGuardHome_linux_armv7.tar.gz”. The ‘v’ was missing from “armv7” in this command, which meant that the file could not be unzipped! Many thanks to Sebastian for pointing this out!\nStep by step | AdGuard Home Raspberry Pi installation Step 1: First, you need to install the Raspberry OS on your Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s SD card. To do this, you can download the Raspberry Pi Imager tool from raspberrypi.com. With this tool, you can easily install the required Raspberry Pi OS on the SD card.\nStep 2: Once you have downloaded Raspberry Pi Imager, you can install it on your computer. After successful installation and starting the program, you will be greeted by the Raspberry Pi OS Imager dashboard, as shown in the image.\nStep 3: Then click on the ‘Select’ button, then on ‘Raspberry Pi OS (other)’ and then on the operating system ‘Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64 bit).’ Step 4: After selecting the Raspberry Pi OS image, click on the ‘SD card’ button and then select the SD card that you have inserted into your SD card reader and intend to use later in the Raspberry Pi.\nStep 5: Finally, click on the ‘gear icon (settings)’ to configure some settings for writing the image to the SD card. Adjust the following settings:\nOptionally assign a host name\nEnable SSH and assign a secure password\nSet language settings\nDisable telemetry\nEject media after completion Once all settings have been made, click on ‘Save’.\nStep 6: After completing the previous steps, you can now click on ‘Write’ to write the Raspberry Pi OS image to the SD card. This process may take a while.\nStep 7: After writing the image to the SD card, you can insert the card into the powered-off Raspberry Pi, connect the network cable to your router or switch, and then connect the Raspberry Pi to the power supply. After about 30 seconds, the Raspberry Pi should boot up.\nStep 8: In the next step, we need to find out which IP address the Raspberry Pi has obtained via DHCP. You can easily check this in your router\u0026rsquo;s network settings / DHCP leases. The device should then be displayed in the list. You should assign a static IP address to the device in your DHCP server/router so that no problems arise with DNS resolution in the network when using the DNS server later. Step 9: Once you know the IP address of the Raspberry Pi, you can open a terminal window (in this example under Windows 11) or the ‘Putty’ tool. Enter the following command: ssh pi@IP address Raspberry When connecting for the first time, you will need to confirm the fingerprint for the SSH connection. Answer ‘yes’ to the question (see image). You will then be asked for the password you assigned in the Raspberry Pi OS Imager settings. Step 10: The next step is to update the Raspberry Pi OS to the latest version. You can do this with the following command.\nsudo apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt-get upgrade This update process may take a while. If this message appears: Repository ‘http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye InRelease’ changed its ‘Version’ value from ‘11.3’ to ‘11.4’, you can perform a distribution upgrade with the following command:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade When the installation process is complete, restart the system by entering sudo reboot. Step 11: After restarting the Raspberry Pi and reconnecting via SSH, we can finally install AdGuard Home on the Raspberry Pi. To do this, we first need the installation package for AdGuard Home. To download the required installation package, enter the following command in the terminal window. Download the AdGuard installation package:\nwget https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/download/v0.107.11/AdGuardHome_linux_armv7.tar.gz Unzip the installation package: sudo tar xvf AdGuardHome_linux_armv7.tar.gz\nChange to the AdGuard directory: cd AdGuardHome Install AdGuard: sudo ./AdGuardHome -s install After successful installation, you can continue with the configuration via a web browser. To do this, simply enter the IP address followed by port 3000 in the address bar of your browser. http://IP-Adresse:3000 You should then see the AdGuard welcome dashboard shown in the image.\nStep 12: For security reasons, the admin web interface should only be accessible via the LAN / management network. Therefore, select the interface with the IP address of your Raspberry Pi in the first pull-down menu. If you have multiple networks, guest networks, or VLANs in operation, you can leave the pull-down menu under “DNS Server” set to “All Interfaces”; otherwise, select the interface of your Raspberry Pi here as well. Step 13: On the next page of the wizard, you must assign a user name and password for access to AdGuard. Please note that the password you choose must be a truly secure password to prevent misuse of the DNS server! Step 14: In the next window, you will see a configuration guide for various devices and an overview of the IP addresses that the AdGuard DNS server is listening to. When you click ‘Next’, you will be taken to the AdGuard Home login window. Step 15: After entering your username and password, the AdGuard Home dashboard will be displayed. Here you can evaluate the DNS server\u0026rsquo;s request statistics and, of course, further configure AdGuard. Summary – AdGuard Raspberry Pi installation As you can see, installing AdGuard Home on a Raspberry Pi is actually not that difficult! Of course, you will need to configure AdGuard a little (DNS over https, assign blacklists, etc.) before it can start working properly. I will show you how to configure AdGuard in a separate post or video on my YouTube channel. An overview of good blacklists for AdGuard or pihole, as well as an overview of public DNS servers that are committed to data protection and security, can be found further down in this post ‘AdGuard Raspberry Pi Installation’.

In this video, I also show you how to properly secure your internal DNS server ‘Pi-hole’ using the UFW firewall (Uncomplicated Firewall). The prerequisite for the upcoming step-by-step guide is that you already have a current Raspberry OS installed on your Raspberry Pi. For those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t have Raspberry Pi OS on your little box yet, I\u0026rsquo;ve created a quick guide for this in the next paragraph. Installing Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi is quick and easy with the Raspberry Pi Imager. All you need is a microSD card + a dummy slot in SD card format and an SD card reader. You can download the Raspberry Pi Imager here: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/\nPi-hole on a Raspberry Pi – installation process Raspberry OS After downloading, open Raspberry PI Imager (in this example for Windows), insert an SD card into your SD reader and select the appropriate OS for the Raspberry Pi in the Imager. Make sure that you select either the 64-bit or 32-bit version of Raspberry PI OS Lite. The Lite version is sufficient for operating Pi-hole. After selecting the appropriate OS, select the appropriate SD card for the image and, before clicking Write, click on the gear icon on the Raspberry PI Imager interface, enable access via SSH, and assign a secure password for access. Install Pihole Install Pi-Hole on a Raspberry Pi First, we will install and set up Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi. Prerequisite for this tutorial is that you have already installed the Raspberry OS on your Raspberry Pi and that you have connected it to your network. This means connecting it to your router, turning it on, and then finding the IP address in your router\u0026rsquo;s network overview.\nWe will need this IP address later to access the Raspberry Pi via SSH.\nDevice: A board from the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ series or higher is sufficient to operate a Pi-hole DNS server. Requirements: Raspberry Pi with the latest Raspberry OS Connect the Raspberry Pi to your router and check which IP address has been assigned to the Raspberry Pi in your network. Step-by-step guide to installing Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi: Step 1 First, we connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH. To do this, open a terminal window (I use Windows Terminal on Windows) and enter the following command: ssh pi@\u0026lt;IP address of your Raspberry Pi\u0026gt; When you connect via SSH for the first time, you will be asked if you want to trust the SSH key. Confirm this question with ‘yes’.\nYou will then need to enter the password you created for login.\nStep 2 First, we will log in as the root user permanently for this session.\n1sudo su Then we update the Raspberry OS with the following command:\n1apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt-get upgrade -y Step 3 We start the installation of the Pi-hole DNS server by entering the following command:\n1curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash Step 4 When the installation of Pi-hole is complete, you will be greeted by the installation wizard. Select ‘OK’ and start the setup dialog.\nStep 5 If you have not yet assigned a fixed/static IP address to your Raspberry Pi in your router (FritzBox, Speedport, pfsense, etc.), you can do this after the installation is complete. In this window, select ‘Yes’ and then press the Enter key.\nStep 6 The next window will display the IP address of the Pi-hole. You must then assign this IP address as a fixed address on your router / DHCP server so that the Pi-hole DNS server can be accessed later.\nStep 7 Next, select an upstream DNS provider for resolving requests from your network. Here you can select one from the list; in my case, I chose OpenDNS, which also supports DNSSEC. You can change your selection later at any time, which I would recommend doing. A list of DNS servers that are also privacy-friendly can be found further down in this tutorial.\nStep 8 In the selection window for selecting a blacklist (filter list), only the StevenBlack blacklist is currently available. However, this filter list is definitely recommended, but can be changed or supplemented with additional lists in the Pi-hole web interface.\nStep 9 Install the Pi-hole web admin dashboard After clicking on ‘OK’, the configuration window for the Pi-hole web interface will appear. Please leave the default selection ‘ON’. This will allow you to administer everything in your browser later.\nStep 10 To enable the use of the web interface, Pi-hole comes with its own lightweight web server called lighttpd. Here, too, you should normally leave the default setting and install this web server.\nStep 11 In the current window, you can choose whether Pi-hole should create logs for events. Here, too, I would leave the default selection.\nStep 12 When selecting ‘Privacy Mode’, you must choose which mode is right for you. For my part, I use the ‘Show Everything’ mode in my own network.\nIf you want to use Pi-Hole for business purposes, I would advise you to use ‘Anonymous Mode**’ in accordance with the GDPR.\nStep 13 ![First login to Pi-hole](/images/posts/pihole/Install Pi-hole on Raspberry Pi Step 12.jpg) In the last step of the Pi-hole installation routine, you will receive the most important information for later access to the Pi-hole DNS server. First, you will see the IP address of the Pi-hole DNS server. Then you will see the address you can use to access the Pi-hole web interface. In my case, it is **http://172.18.18.62/admin**\nAnd very importantly, you will also see the generated password, which you will need to authenticate when logging in via the shell or the web interface. Further down in this post, I will show you how to change the password.\nPi-hole on a Raspberry Pi – tips and tricks Here I have put together some useful tips that you will certainly find useful in your everyday life or when setting up your Pi-hole.\nUpdating Pi-hole - Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi In the Pi-hole web interface, you will see a notification in the footer when a new update is available. Unfortunately, the update can only be installed via an SSH connection. To install the update, connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH:\n1ssh pi@\u0026amp;\u0026lt;IP address of the Raspberry Pi\u0026gt; 2# After entering your password, enter the following command to execute the update: 3pihole -up 4# After the update, the Pi-hole should be rebooted. Change the Pi-hole password for login - Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi You can change the password for logging in to your Pi-hole DNS server with the following command.\n1# Option 1: Change password with display of new password 2pihole -a -p NewPassword 3# Option 2: Change password without display 4pihole -a -p 5# You will then be prompted to enter your new password, which, as is typical for Unix, will not be displayed when you type it. Change Pi-hole IP address - Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi To change the IP address of the Pi-hole DNS server afterwards, you must edit the dhspsc.conf file via SSH.\n1# Connect to the Pi-hole via SSH and then enter the following command to edit the dhcpcd.conf file with the Nano editor 2sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf 3# In the Nano editor window, change the new IP address here under ‘static-ip-address’, save your entries with CTRL+O and ENTER, and exit the Nano editor with CTRL+X. See next image Reconfigure/set up Pi-hole - Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi To run the Pi-hole installation setup again, you can connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH and restart the setup with the following command\n1pihole -r Uninstalling Pi-hole - Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi If the Pi-hole DNS server is not your thing, you can uninstall Pi-hole again with the following command.\n1# Uninstall Pi-hole 2pihole uninstall Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi – blacklist recommendation In addition to the pre-installed blacklist ‘SteveBlack’, there are several other good lists that we would like to introduce to you here.\nPlease note! Please do not use too many lists. Processing the lists has a significant impact on performance and can cause the Raspberry Pi to crash.\nI have had very good experiences with the blacklists presented here and would therefore like to recommend them.\nBlacklist SteveBlack The blacklist that we installed when installing Pi-hole is very comprehensive and should continue to be used. This list is very comprehensive and currently contains around 150,000 entries.\nThe following host categories are included:\nPorn Adware Malware Fake news Gambling (suspicious hosts) Social https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-porn-social/hosts Blacklist adaway.org Ad blocker https://adaway.org/hosts.txt\nBlacklist SmartTV tracking The name says it all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perflyst/PiHoleBlocklist/master/SmartTV.txt\nBlacklist EasyPrivacy Tracking and telemetry https://v.firebog.net/hosts/Easyprivacy.txt\nBlacklist EasyList Ad blocker https://v.firebog.net/hosts/Easylist.txt\nBlacklist AdGuardDNS This blacklist comes from competitor AdGuard and is also very comprehensive. https://v.firebog.net/hosts/AdguardDNS.txt\nMalicious URL Blocklist (from URLHaus) https://adguardteam.github.io/HostlistsRegistry/assets/filter_11.txt\nThe Big List of Hacked Malware Web Sites https://adguardteam.github.io/HostlistsRegistry/assets/filter_9.txt\nBlacklist Telemetry Microsoft / Windows Prevent telemetry collection from Microsoft products https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker/master/data/hosts/spy.txt\nTrusted DNS servers - Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi Here is a list of privacy-compliant DNS server providers that do not log data and are censorship-free. For me personally, only a DNS server with DoT is currently an option for security reasons. Thanks to privacy-handbuch.de for the list of DNS servers.\nFreifunk München (normal DNS, DNS-over-TLS, and DNS-over-HTTPS) 1IPv4: 5.1.66.255 2IPv6: 2001:678:e68:f000:: 3Server name: dot.ffmuc.net 4IPv4: 185.150.99.255 5IPv6: 2001:678:ed0:f000:: 6Server name: dot.ffmuc.net Digitale Gesellschaft (CH) (DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS!) 1IPv4: 185.95.218.42 2IPv6: 2a05:fc84::42 3Server name: dns.digitale-gesellschaft.ch 4IPv4: 185.95.218.43 5IPv6: 2a05:fc84::43 6Server name: dns.digitale-gesellschaft.ch Censurfridns Denmark (aka.

Especially in your home network, this DNS server can be implemented wonderfully as a name server on a consumer router such as FritzBox, Speedport, and others. This provides excellent protection against tracking, advertising, malware, and phishing on all devices in the network. Of course, this protection is not 100% effective, but it is certainly better than doing nothing to protect your data privacy. Feel free to send me any suggestions for blacklists that you use. I would really appreciate it!\n","date":"March 30, 2022","hero":"/images/posts/pihole/pi-hole-installation.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/privacy/pihole/pihole-auf-einen-raspberry-pi-installieren/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"install-and-set-up-pi-hole-on-a-raspberry-pi\"\u003eInstall and set up Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this tutorial, ‘\u003cstrong\u003eInstall Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi\u003c/strong\u003e’, I will show you how to install the Pi-hole DNS server and set up a recursive DNS server with Unbound.\nThe step-by-step installation is fohttps://secure-bits.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pi-hole-auf-Raspberry-Pi-installieren-Schritt-3.jpghtly on a Raspberry Pi in this tutorial.\nIn another tutorial here on SecureBits (\u003ca href=\"https://secure-bits.org/pi-hole-installation/%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehttps://secure-bits.org/pi-hole-installation/)\u003c/a\u003e, I already showed you how to install it on a Debian system in a virtual machine and explained why and how you should use a Pi-Hole DNS server.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["“security”","“linux”","‘network’","“pi-hole”","“raspberry pi”","tutorials","“video”"],"title":"Pi-hole Raspberry Pi Installation"},{"categories":["“Hardware”","“Network”","“Security”","“Tutorials”","‘Video’"],"contents":"Setting up FritzBox port forwarding Today\u0026rsquo;s post is about how to set up FritzBox port forwarding correctly, what you can use it for, and what risks arise from using port forwarding. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to set up port forwarding in your FritzBox. For those of you who would prefer to watch a video tutorial, there is a video entitled “Setting up port forwarding on a FritzBox” on my YouTube channel.\nVideo tutorial on ‘Setting up FritzBox port forwarding’ Tutorial - Setting up FritzBox port forwarding In this step-by-step guide, I will show you how to set up port forwarding on a FritzBox.\nTools: Internet browser. What do you need? A FritzBox router. Steps for setting up FritzBox port forwarding: Step 1 Open the FritzBox login page. Normally, this login page can be found at https://192.168.178.1.\nStep 2 After successfully logging in, you will be taken to the dashboard overview page of your FritzBox. This overview may look slightly different depending on your firmware.\nStep 3 In the left-hand menu, select the menu item Internet-\u0026gt;Sharing.\nStep 4 When the Internet Sharing overview window opens, click on the button Add device for sharing.\nStep 5 First, open the Device pull-down menu and select a device for which you want to set up port forwarding, or scroll down to the bottom of the pull-down menu and select Add IP address manually.\nStep 6 Once you have selected or set up a device, click on the New sharing button to set up a new port forwarding. A pop-up window will open to set up the sharing.\nStep 7 In the Set up sharing window, you can choose from various predefined port forwarding options such as https, http, ftp, etc., or you can set up your own forwarding and select Other application. In this example, I am setting up port 22 for an SSH connection to the Playstation4 device.\nIn the pop-up window below, you must select the Enable sharing checkbox and select the Internet protocol (IPv4 and IPv6, IPv4, or IPv6) for which you want to enable sharing.\nAfter making your selection, confirm the configuration by clicking the OK button.\nStep 8 In the Device sharing overview, you will now see the previously configured sharing at the bottom. To confirm this, complete the sharing setup by clicking on the OK button.\nStep 9 To activate the created share, you must click on the Apply button in the Shares window. The sharing is now marked as active in the overview.\nExposed Host - Sharing As shown in the image above, it is also possible to enable all ports for a device (Exposed Host). This general enabling of all ports for a device is used, for example, when a hardware firewall is operated behind the FritzBox.\nSecurity note Exposed Host The use of port forwarding for all ports for a device (Exposed Host) should only be carried out by operators who have expert knowledge of the use of Internet protocols and firewall configuration. By selecting this setting, the forwarded device is accessible from the Internet without protection and is therefore vulnerable to attack.\nIndependent port forwarding UPnP The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) function, which is found in routers in general and not only in the FritzBox, is used for communication between IP-based communication participants in a network and enables devices, among other things, to negotiate independent port forwarding with the router (FritzBox). Unfortunately, this feature is often exploited to allow devices in the home network to open ports in the firewall independently, which can then be misused for DDos attacks or denial of service attacks. In general, port forwarding should only be set up manually to ensure the best possible overview of open doors in the firewall.\nImportant information about port forwarding What is a port?\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(Protocol)\nWhat is port forwarding / port sharing?\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portweiterleitung\nOther topics related to FritzBox configuration FritzBox Set up guest access\n","date":"March 19, 2022","hero":"/images/posts/fritzbox/Video-FritzBox-Portfreigabe.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/fritzbox/fritzbox-portfreigabe/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"setting-up-fritzbox-port-forwarding\"\u003eSetting up FritzBox port forwarding\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026rsquo;s post is about how to set up \u003cstrong\u003eFritzBox port forwarding\u003c/strong\u003e correctly, what you can use it for, and what risks arise from using port forwarding.\nFollow the step-by-step instructions below to set up port forwarding in your FritzBox.\nFor those of you who would prefer to watch a video tutorial, there is a video entitled “Setting up port forwarding on a FritzBox” on my YouTube channel.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["“fritzbox”","“network”","“security”","‘tutorials’","“video”"],"title":"Tip - Setting up Fritzbox port forwarding correctly"},{"categories":["Linux","Privacy","Tutorials","Network"],"contents":"Pihole Installation Debian - Protect your network from tracking and advertising PLEASE NOTE!!!\nThese instructions refer to the installation of Pihole version 5 and not the current version 6.\nThe differences between VERSION 5 and VERSION 6 are not really different in terms of the process. Version 6 is no longer based on PHP and does not use a lighthtp instance.\nI will also publish a tutorial for version 6 of Pihole here soon. If you want to declare war on trackers, in-app advertising, and advertising messages on your home network, you should take a look at Pihole. Of course, some of you will now think, “I use an ad blocker when surfing, so why do I need an extra device for such services?!” I can understand this question, but the answer is quite simple. A Pihole installation Debian / Server protects you centrally from advertising and trackers, as Pi-hole acts as a central DNS server in the network and thus not only protects computers from annoying snooping tools, but also other devices in the network. For example, smart TVs, advertising in apps on your smartphone, and it also functions as a “parental control.” This ensures that your children are protected when surfing the Internet.\nHow does Pihole work? This system provides a DNS server in the home network, which can be used to resolve domain queries from the connected devices in the network.\nBased on exclusion lists (blacklists) of domains known as tracking or advertising domains, if there is a positive match, the requesting device on the network is given an unusable IP address. This means that the unusable IP address cannot be resolved and the device cannot resolve the domain.\nFurthermore, the Pi-hole DNS server also allows you to track the history of visited domains, which is a data protection decision that each user must make for themselves. The use of blacklists also limits this system. By processing this list, only the domains contained therein can be checked. Other domains not included in the list cannot be checked due to the lack of content analysis functionality and can therefore be accessed.\nFurthermore, the check only takes place using the domain check mentioned above. Access via direct entry of the domain\u0026rsquo;s IP address is not checked.\nWho is a Pihole Debian installation intended for? A Pihole installation Debian is ideal for anyone who wants to centrally protect their home network from advertising on end devices and trackers. The installation effort is minimal and operation with a Raspberry Pi is economical in terms of power consumption.\nHardware requirements for Pihole installation Debian As mentioned, the requirements are minimal and affordable for any budget. You can install Pi-hole either in a permanent virtual environment, on a single-board computer such as the Raspberry Pi, or on other mini-computers. You are also welcome to use my favorite board, APU4D4, for this task. You can find a post about this board here.\nHardware requirements Minimum 512 MB RAM, preferably 1 GB Minimum 2 GB free hard disk space, preferably 4 GB Supported operating systems As a Docker container Or as an installation on the following supported operating systems: Distribution Version Architecture Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye / Bookworm ARM Ubuntu 23.x / 24.x / 25.x ARM / x86_64 Debian 11 / 12 ARM / x86_64 / i386 Selection of supported Debian-based operating systems\nHowTo - Pihole Installation Debian In this HowTo, I will show you how to install the Pi-hole DNS server on a virtual Debian 9 instance. The installation shown here is the same as the installation on a Raspberry Pi. Now let\u0026rsquo;s move on to the installation of our little Pi-hole DNS server.\nPrerequisites - Pihole Installation Debian The prerequisite for this is a virtual instance of Debian 11 or 12 in a virtual environment, in my case on a Proxmox server. Other virtualizations such as VMWare, Virtual-Box, etc. work just as well. You can find out how to install Pi-Hole on a Raspberry Pi in this tutorial: Go to tutorial\nRequired tools and prerequisites: putty or other SSH client Debian-based OS Step 1 - Pihole installation Debian: Install Pihole Debian - Image 1\nInstall Pihole Debian - Image 2\nPihole Installation Debian Image 3\nPihole installation Debian image 4\nConnect the SSH client to your Debian instance as a user with root privileges and then enter the following command in your terminal window.\n1sudo -s root@\u0026lt;IP address instance\u0026gt; 2wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net Then enter the following command:\n1bash basic-install.sh If you receive an error message stating that you do not have the necessary rights, you are not logged in as root user. Then please precede the command “bash basic-install.sh” with the command “sudo”. It should then look like this:\n1sudo bash basic-install.sh If the Pi-Hole installation was successful, you should see the Pi-Hole installation routine GUI as shown in the following image.\nGUI Pihole Installation Debian\nStep 2 - Pihole Installation Debian: In this step, we will configure the Pihole installation DebianPiHole DNS server. This configuration is done entirely through the GUI installation routine. Here, we need to specify which external DNS server your Internet provider uses, which IP address your Pi-hole should listen to later, and the configuration of the default gateway used.\nDefault gateway In most cases, the default gateway should be the router provided to you by your Internet provider. Therefore, you must enter the IP address of your router as the IP address for the default gateway. For most routers, this should be 192.168.178.1 (Fritz-Box) or 192.168.2.1 (Telekom).\nIf you have a hardware firewall between your internet provider\u0026rsquo;s router and your network, you will need to enter the IP address of your hardware firewall.\n(Image 7) Select the external DNS server for this by simply entering the IP address of your router, as this is usually responsible for the external resolution of external domains.\nImage 7 - Select external DNS server\n(Image 8) Select the blacklist based on ads and tracking codes to be blocked. These lists can be replaced or edited after installation.\nImage 8 - Selecting the blacklist (can also be replaced by others after installation)\n(Image 9) Select the IP protocols (IPv4, IPv6) for which ads and tracking codes are to be blocked. It is best to select both protocol types here.\nImage 9 - Select the protocol in which ads should be blocked\n(Image 10) In the next step, you will see the current IP configuration that has been assigned to your Pi-hole installation and which you can now adjust according to your requirements. Please be sure to use a static IP address for this, as you will then need to store this in the DNS assignment for your clients in the network, which will then use Pi-hole for DNS resolution. If this IP address does not match the IP address assigned to the Pi-hole DNS server, you will encounter massive DNS resolution problems later during operation and will not be able to access any domains on the Internet.\nImage 10 - Overview of the current IP configuration of the Pi-hole DNS server\n(Image 11) We can leave the preselection for installing the Pi-hole web interface as it is. This allows you to access the web interface via your favorite browser by entering the Pi-hole IP address / pi-hole (example http://172.16.16.61/admin) or http://pi-hole/admin, so that you can conveniently carry out further configurations.\nImage 11 - Confirm installation of the Pihole web interface\nStep 3: (Image 12) Confirm the preselection to install a lighttpd server, as you will need this for the Pihole web interface.\nImage 12 - Confirm installation of the lighttpd server\n(Image 13) In the next step, I would also recommend that you enable log queries to be recorded. These are used later during operation to store violations, for example, and make it easier for you to make adjustments to the configuration.\nImage 13 - Enable Pihole logging\n(Image 14) - Pihole offers several options for logging the domains and IP addresses visited. You can decide for yourself which logging level you want to select here.\nImage 14 - ‘Privacy mode’ setting\n(Images 15, 16, and 17) In the next window, you will now find an overview of your configuration, the IP address you can use to log in (if you change the IP address, you must restart the instance), and the password for logging in to the web interface. You can change this password later. More on this in the next step.\nImage 15 - Notification that the Pihole installation is complete\nImage 16 - Display of the password for logging into the web interface\nStep 4 - Pihole installation Debian : (Image 17) Now open your browser and enter the IP address displayed earlier followed by /admin in the browser address bar and press Enter. The login screen of your Pi-hole DNS server\u0026rsquo;s web interface should now be displayed. Enter the password you entered earlier to log in and you will be welcomed by the Pihole dashboard.\nImage 17 - Pihole dashboard | Pihole installation Debian\nStep 5 - Pihole installation Debian: In the last step, you must ensure that all devices can use the Pi-hole DNS server for DNS resolution on the Internet. To do this, simply log in to your router, provided that it is also responsible for DHCP on your network, and enter the IP address of your Pi-hole DNS server in the network settings (DHCP server settings) under “DNS server.” However, the newly assigned DNS server will only be used after the DHCP lease has been renewed and will therefore not be noticed by the clients on their own. The easiest way is to disconnect your device from the network and reconnect it. The new configuration will then be loaded and the devices should appear in the device overview in Pi-hole.\nHow a domain query works in conjunction with Pi-hole in \u0026gt; Wenn Sie Fragen oder Feedback zu diesem Blog oder YouTube-Kanal haben, nutzen Sie bitte meine Hilfeseite.

I have listed some components that you may want to purchase at the end of this article.\nEven though some of these links are affiliate links, they are not intended to enrich me with a commission from products you purchase (the sales price remains the same for you and you support this blog), but rather reflect a clear recommendation on my part as additional protection against attacks.\nI only recommend what I use myself in the same or a similar form!\nProtection against man-in-the-middle attacks | Protective measures Protection of active network components (firewall, switch, etc.) Access control for components Replace standard user data with secure passwords Make physical access to network components more difficult (lockable room or network cabinet) Mechanical locking of ports Protection of endpoints such as PCs, mobile devices, etc. Antivirus protection Set up device locks for mobile devices Correctly configured firewall Correctly configured managed switch Patch management for endpoints, servers, and active network components Grant access rights as much as necessary and as little as possible No use of standard passwords Only enable or provide server services and services in general that are really necessary Protect unused USB ports Protection for passive network components Mechanical locking of ports Access control where possible Additional extended protection against man-in-the-middle attacks Protection against attacks on switches Replace unmanaged switches with managed switches Divide the network into individual virtual subnetworks (VLANs) Use dynamic ARP inspection against MAC flooding and ARP poisoning Bind ports to specific MAC addresses Disable switch ports that are not needed Securing endpoints Setting static ARP entries for the default gateway Firewall configuration Blocking ICMP type 5 redirect messages Set up DNSSEC Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks | General network protection measures Secure network traffic with encrypted connections Use authentication (Radius server, Active Directory, etc.) Do not simply ignore certificate errors and accept them without hesitation Important for internal network domains Only use publicly resolvable top-level domain names for internal domains, as otherwise no certificates can be issued for internal domains that are certified by a public certification authority and will therefore always display a certificate error when an internal https domain is called up.title: \u0026ldquo;Schutz vor Man-in-the-Middle-Angriffe erhalten\u0026rdquo; Man-in-the-middle attacks - My tips for security enhancements for your network In this list (* affiliate links - this helps support this blog), I have compiled a list of components that I use myself and therefore consider useful. Of course, everyone has to decide for themselves an\nd adapt to their own requirements! I would like to point out that not everyone uses 19\u0026quot; components in their network or wants to spend so much money on certain things.\nTools for mechanical protection of network components and end devices Mechanical protection to prevent unauthorized connection of network cables to open RJ45 ports on network components. Mechanical security to protect open USB ports from unauthorized use IMPORTANT!!!\nAn absolute must before using manipulated USB sticks and modified charging cables from mobile devices. The use of such sticks and cables is the most common way to gain access to a network!!!\nFor anyone who uses 19\u0026quot; components in their network infrastructure or wants to store such components in a lockable manner and prefers a clean, tidy solution. I personally use this network cabinet with a depth of 600 mm and 16U and am very satisfied with it, as the manufacturer also offers a wide range of accessories.\nProtection of active network components Managed switch TP-Link TL-SG2428P 24-port Gigabit Managed PoE Switch with 4 SFP slots Unlike switches from Ubiquiti, for example, this switch offers excellent configuration options for setting up security-related settings to protect against the attack scenarios described above. You also have the option of operating this switch standalone, i.e. without SDN. This switch is also available in a cheaper version without POE support. TP-Link TL-SG3428 24-port Gigabit L2 Managed Network LAN Switch with 4 SFP slots My access points Not required!!! These are just to give you an idea of which network components I am currently using, as I am often asked about this.\nTP-Link Access Point EAP683 UR I have used these access points throughout my house and outdoors. I run Unifi Controller as a virtual machine on my Proxmox server. What I like about these access points is that they can also be installed outdoors, making them an inexpensive alternative to the usually more expensive ACs from other manufacturers that offer comparable features. Furthermore, the support with new and up-to-date firmware has been really great so far. Before these access points found their way to me, I was using access points from Sophos. However, their proprietary use (only usable with Sophos firewall products) was a thorn in my side and they were simply too expensive for my requirements (including outdoor use). Hardware firewall used For me, using a hardware firewall is a clear “yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a must.” For anyone who uses smart home technology, KNX, or a home office and takes security seriously, there is no way around this component. I also live in a “smart home,” but everything is neatly separated in terms of network technology, and I can disconnect services that are homesick for their manufacturer,8iiiiiiiiii.\nIn my professional consulting work, including for larger projects in the construction industry (electrical engineering), I have seen technical electrical installations using KNX that were unsecured and located on the same network as the IT infrastructure, meaning that any attacker could have gained access to the building control system.\nPersonally, I use the hardware linked below and have been using OPNsense as my firewall distro for years.\nProtectli Vault V1610 – 6 ports, micro appliance/mini PC – Intel N6005, 6X 2.5G NICs, 16 GB LPDDR RAM Conclusion on protection against man-in-the-middle attacks As you have read, there are many ways to protect yourself against man-in-the-middle attacks. With these tips and tricks, you and your network are well protected, not only against sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks, but also against other attacks on your network. This list of measures is quite comprehensive, but it is not exhaustive. However, other measures would require extensive knowledge of IT networks and security, so I have deliberately omitted them, as I believe these tips are sufficient for home use and in most companies.

This attack tactic is often mentioned in the press and other publications. But in this article, I would like to explain exactly what it is and how it works.\nIf anything is unclear or you have further questions on this topic, please contact me via the contact form.\nWhat is a man-in-the-middle attack? A man-in-the-middle attack is a scenario in which a communication path (see image above) between two communication partners is intercepted by a third party or the data stream is redirected via the third party\u0026rsquo;s attack computer. This scenario can be carried out at various points in the communication path\u0026rsquo;s network. The network points can be compromised network or user devices, for example.\nFamous examples of such attacks include the so-called Bundestrojaner, which is once again the talk of the town due to the debate about breaking the encryption of encrypted messenger services, and the interception of Internet service provider nodes by the friends of the National Security Agency (Wikipedia) (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency), which became known to the general public through the Snowden leaks.\nHow does a man-in-the-middle attack work? There are basically two types of attack scenarios. In these scenarios, the attacks are divided into two methods.\nMethod 1 refers to eavesdropping/recording the communication path Method 2 refers to redirecting a communication path to, for example, an attacker\u0026rsquo;s computer. Method 1 – Eavesdropping/recording a communication path (sniffing) In sniffing, a network sniffer or mirror port is used to record or eavesdrop on the communication between two communication partners on the communication path. By using a software tool such as Wireshark (there are countless other software tools available), the data stream of the communication path can be compromised. To do this, the attacker must compromise a network point (end device, network device, or server) in the communication path using the sniffing tool. Furthermore, a mirror port can be used on the switch to mirror the port and thus the data packets of the connected computer to be compromised to the attacker\u0026rsquo;s computer. By eavesdropping, ports, IP addresses, protocols, and communication forms can be analyzed in detail, which is why this method is often used to scout and prepare an attack. Types of attacks include password attacks, detecting unauthorized communication between two communication partners, determining the type of applications used on the communication devices, identifying forms of attack that can be used later through security vulnerabilities, and skimming access data. The advantage of this passive eavesdropping method is that it is difficult to detect and therefore difficult to defend against.\nMethod 2 – Redirecting data packets / classic man-in-the-middle attack With this method, the attacker uses various redirection methods to prevent data from being sent via the intended communication path and instead redirects the data packets. In this case, the hacker\u0026rsquo;s point of attack (e.g., proxy server) pretends to be the other communication partner when two endpoints are communicating and can thus compromise the connection. As already mentioned, several methods can be used for this purpose. The most common methods are the following. On the one hand, the user device is redirected to the attacker\u0026rsquo;s device and forwarded to the other endpoint of the communication path (web server, end device, etc.). On the other hand, the redirection is not routed via the network\u0026rsquo;s intended standard gateway, but via a proxy server or by redirection to the other communication partner (see Figures 1 and 2 below).\nOne disadvantage of this active method is that it is easier to detect, as it actively interferes with the communication path. In contrast to sniffing, not only can data packets or the communication of participants be intercepted/collected, but the communication can also be intercepted/modified so that the other participant is unaware of this. This means that the problems are more diverse and can cause massive damage.\nExamples include:\nTheft of access data Interception of tokens such as TANs for online banking Exchange of information, for example to redirect bank transfers to a different bank account Theft of credit card data And many other scenarios Conclusion on man-in-the-middle attacks This article is only a brief introduction to how a man-in-the-middle attack works, as this topic is very comprehensive. I will explore this topic in more detail in future articles, giving you an even deeper insight into this subject. But first, I would like to make one thing clear: Please make sure that all your communications are encrypted in future. This encryption should not only apply to communication on the Internet via protocol 443 or 8443, but also to other types of communication. Examples include messenger services (Signal, Matrix, Threema), file exchange via sftp or ssh, use of encrypted VPN connections, and so on\u0026hellip;\nProtection against man-in-the-middle attacks Find out how you can protect yourself and your network from such attacks in the next article.\n","date":"January 25, 2021","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/security/man-in-the-middle/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"man-in-the-middle-attack--definition\"\u003eMan-in-the-middle attack – definition\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026rsquo;s post is about \u003cstrong\u003eman-in-the-middle attacks\u003c/strong\u003e.

In this article, you will learn why PowerShell should be your tool of choice for administration.\nYou can find out what the classic command line interpreter CMD is all about in this article: CMD commands at a glance\nInstalling Windows PowerShell – A powerful tool Windows PowerShell is a framework that provides administrators and power users with an indispensable tool for automating and managing cross-platform systems. This framework consists of a command line interpreter and a scripting language. This Windows command line shell is based on the .NET Framework Common Language Runtime (CLR) and .NET Framework and uses the concept of a cmdlet (pronounced “command-let”). These individual cmdlets (for example, for Azure services and Office 365) can be combined with each other, making them very powerful for performing complex tasks.\nWindows PowerShell versions Windows PowerShell is available in two different versions. The first version, PowerShell “Legacy,” is based on the current .Net Framework and is currently available in build version 5.1 with a full command set. The second version is called PowerShell “Core” and is platform-independent and based on .Net Core, but has a limited command set. The current build version 6.1 (at the time of this post) is available here.\nDifference between Windows PowerShell and CMD The difference that is immediately noticeable when the two command prompts are started is the different background color. Here, the PowerShell command prompt has a blue background and the good old CMD command line has a black background. This allows you to immediately see which command prompt you are currently using.\nCMD batch Windows PowerShell batch\nWhy a new command line? PowerShell will replace the CMD command line in the future, as it has a wider range of functions and can be expanded (cmdlets). PowerShell is generally essential for system administration, as certain settings can only be implemented using the shell. This is the case, for example, when administering larger Office 365 deployments (creating users via CSV, etc.). Unlike most command line shells, which accept and return text, Windows PowerShell accepts .NET Framework objects and relies on the .NET Framework Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the .NET Framework. This change meant that a new command line tool was required for this application, and so Windows PowerShell was created. The combination of cmdlets gives this shell a very powerful range of functions and, by using the Windows PowerShell Core version, it can also be used across systems, for example to operate Linux.\nCMD commands at a glance In this article, I will discuss the command line tool “CMD” and provide an overview of the most commonly used and most important commands for the console. Of course, this is also available as a PDF download for you. Just take a look\u0026hellip; Read article\nInstalling Windows PowerShell Most Windows operating systems (Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 or later) already have a version of Windows PowerShell installed. This is updated via Windows Update, or you can manually trigger an update via the command line (see below for instructions).\nLaunching Windows PowerShell Launching PowerShell is easy in all versions of Windows Desktop. Simply click on the Windows logo or magnifying glass icon on your desktop and enter “PowerShell” in the search field. To open the Windows script editor “PowerShell ISE,” you also need to click on the Windows logo or magnifying glass icon and enter “ISE” in the search field.\nOpening Windows PowerShell on Windows Server and Windows Server Core In the Server Core version, simply enter “powershell” in the input window after logging in to the server and confirm with the Enter / Return / Enter key. To close the console window, enter “exit”.\nInstalling Windows PowerShell Core on Windows Important! Installing Windows PowerShell – The following requirements must be met before installation. Universal C Runtime must be installed on all systems prior to Windows 10. This can be installed via the update or directly via download. On systems such as Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 (which hopefully is no longer in use as support has ended), install Windows Management Framework (WMF) 4.0 or higher.\nAn overview of WMF can be found here: WMF overview\nInstallation via MSI package The following installation works for client systems running Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 or later.\nYou can download the latest PowerShell MSI package from GitHub here. Once you have accessed the page, select the “Assets” section and download the MSI package. The MSI file can be identified by the following name:\n1PowerShell-\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;-win-\u0026lt;os-arch\u0026gt;.msi After downloading, you can start the installation of this package by double-clicking on it.\nYou can then start PowerShell as described above.\nInstalling Windows PowerShell via the command line Of course, you can also perform the installation via the command line. This allows you to perform the installation without user interaction. The command line you need to use for an installation with all options enabled is as follows:\n1msiexec.exe /package PowerShell-\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;-win-\u0026lt;os-arch\u0026gt;.msi /quiet ADD_EXPLORER_CONTEXT_MENU_OPENPOWERSHELL=1 ENABLE_PSREMOTING=1 REGISTER_MANIFEST=1 A complete list of command line options for “Msiexec.exe” can be found at Command line options.\nInstalling Windows PowerShell Core on Linux As mentioned at the beginning, PowerShell C## Video tutorial on PowerShell on Udemy I highly recommend Tom Wechsler\u0026rsquo;s course on the Udemy platform.

To do this, enter the following commands in your terminal window:\n1brew cask install powershell Once the installation is complete, you should test that it is working. To do this, start the Windows PowerShell Core installation by entering the command “pwsh”. If you want to upgrade to a newer version, you can do so by entering the following command:\n1brew update 2brew cask upgrade powershell Install dependencies for the PowerShell installation Finally, all dependencies required for the PowerShell installation must be updated.\nXCode command line tools First, we start by installing the XCode command line tools on your system.\n1xcode-select --install Install OpenSSL Next, install OpenSSL. We\u0026rsquo;ll do this again using Brew\n1brew install openssl This completes the installation on macOS and ensures that all dependencies are installed. If you want to uninstall PowerShell Core, proceed as follows.\nUninstalling PowerShell Core on macOS To uninstall, enter the following command in Brew:\n1brew cask uninstall powershell PowerShell Core is now removed from your system. You can then uninstall the paths using the command “sudo rm”. The paths can be found here:\n$PSHOME is /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/6.2.0/. User profiles are read via ~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1. Default profiles are read via $PSHOME/profile.ps1. User modules are read via ~/.local/share/powershell/Modules. Shared modules are read via /usr/local/share/powershell/Modules. Standard modules are read via $PSHOME/Modules. The history of “PSReadline” is recorded in ~/.local/share/powershell/PSReadLine/ConsoleHost_history.txt. Summary I hope this article will be helpful for your project! I will, of course, explore this topic in more depth in future articles, where I will discuss the operation, functions, and available commands in more detail.

In order to surf anonymously on the Internet, the use of a proxy server is essential. In this article, you will learn what special features you need to look for when choosing a proxy server and where you can get one.\nHow it works A proxy server can be viewed as an intermediary or middleman in a network. It receives requests from a proxy client (e.g., desktop) and forwards them on its behalf to the target web server requested by the proxy client.\nTo simplify this process, I will use the following scenario:\nThe proxy server Imagine you are managing a team. Every employee in your team wants to suggest improvements on how to make their work more efficient. Of course, you don\u0026rsquo;t want all your employees running to the boss with their great ideas. So, being the conscientious person you are, you collect all the suggestions, summarize them in your own words, and then present everything to your boss. In this scenario, you are the proxy server, the employees are the proxy clients, and your boss is the web server.\nTypes of proxy servers for anonymizing Internet traffic There are three different types of proxy servers that can act as intermediaries for anonymization, although only two are actually useful for this type of network communication. These three types of servers are divided as follows:\nLevel 1 - Elite Proxies With a Level 1 proxy server, neither your IP address nor the use of a proxy server is disclosed to the web server (none of the variables listed below are sent in the header). This Level 1 server is therefore definitely preferable to the other level servers in terms of anonymity! Level 2 - Anonymous Proxies With this type of proxy server, the other party is informed that the request is being made via a proxy server. However, the IP address is not transmitted and you remain anonymous to the requested server to a certain extent. Level 3 - Transparent proxies Transparent proxies are mostly used and should only be used in a server chain (when several servers are connected in series). This server type transmits the requesting IP address and its status as a proxy server to the other party. The header variables In order to differentiate between the individual levels, you need to take a closer look at the header variables that are inserted into the traffic packets. These variables may be communicated by the proxy server to the other party and are therefore decisive for classification as an anonymization server.\nThe most important variables at a glance 1HTTP_CLIENT_IP 2X_FORWARDED_FOR 3X_HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR 4FORWARDED_FOR 5HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR If you find one of the above variables in the header, the requested web server knows your IP address!\n1HTTP_VIA 2HTTP_FORWARDED 3HTTP_PROXY_CONNECTION The top three variables show the requested web server that the request is being made via a proxy server and may therefore cause the web server to reject the request. This is the case, for example, if you are using a proxy server to try to bypass country restrictions in order to access a video portal that is not available in Germany.\nOverview of available free proxy servers To surf the Internet anonymously, you will of course need a free proxy server.

In this article, I would like to explain these questions and other terms and functions related to MAC addresses.\nWhat is a MAC address? The MAC address is used to identify a network-enabled device (host) in a network. This address is actually unique (more on this later) and ensures that a device can be addressed unambiguously.\nStructure This address consists of a 48-bit address and should be unique worldwide. This address is assigned to layer 2 (data link layer) in the OSI model to ensure addressing in the network.\nStructure of a MAC address\nThe first 24 bits are permanently assigned to the various manufacturers (manufacturer identification) and are allocated by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). This manufacturer identification is also called the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and can be found online in a manufacturer database. The last 24 bits are referred to as the Organizationally Unique Address (OUA) and can be assigned freely by the manufacturer, but only once for each device class.\nBroadcast address A broadcast address is a pseudo-address where all 48 bits are set to “1”.\nBroadcast MAC address:\n1ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff and in bit form 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 and is sent to all devices in the LAN, but cannot be sent to other LANs.\nLink to the IEEE manufacturer database: https://regauth.standards.ieee.org/standards-ra-web/pub/view.html#registries\nDisplay your own MAC address To display the address of your device, there are different commands depending on your operating system that you can enter in the command line (CMD, Powershell, Shell). The commands for displaying the address are as follows for the individual systems:\nWindows physical address First, open the command line (CMD) with the key combination Windows key+R and then enter the following command:\n1ipconfig /all Wenn Sie Fragen oder Feedback zu diesem Blog oder YouTube-Kanal haben, nutzen Sie bitte meine Hilfeseite.

If you are unable to read the IP address using the above commands, use a crossover cable to connect the two computers. This will place both devices in the same network segment, allowing you to use the following commands:\nWindows 1arp -a FreeBSD 1arp -a Linux 1arp -a 2ip neigh Changing a MAC address Changing the address can be useful in some situations. For example, if you want to use a high-availability scenario, changing the address can be very useful. If a server fails in a redundancy network, changing the MAC address on the replacement server can save you the hassle of reconfiguring the system. You can also change other replacement devices in the network in the same way.\nYou can use the following commands for this Windows 1Change the registry entry or, if offered, in the Control Panel Linux 1ifconfig \u0026lt;Device\u0026gt; hw ether \u0026lt;New MAC address\u0026gt; FreeBSD 1ifconfig \u0026lt;Device\u0026gt; link \u0026lt;New MAC address\u0026gt; ARP spoofing (malicious modification) Last but not least, I will discuss the malicious modification of a MAC address. This method is used in man-in-the-middle attacks. Here, the address is also set in the ARP cache, and a manipulated ARP message is sent from host A to host B. Host B is thus given the address of the attacking device, which in turn sends all future packets to the attacker\u0026rsquo;s device instead of to host A as intended. A compromised ARP cache is easily recognizable by the fact that all IP addresses point to one MAC address. You can see an example in the next section.\nExample of ARP spoofing in the ARP cache 1RE1:~# arp -a 2? (192.168.1.10) on 00:2c:33:2f:7e:88 [ether] on eth0 3?

Most of you have probably read or heard somewhere that everyone is talking about secure communication. But what is secure communication and why can normal communication channels be intercepted (sniffed)? In this article, I would like to address the topic of “sniffing” and show you how you can protect yourself against such sniffing attacks. Following Edward Snowden\u0026rsquo;s revelations, you are probably all familiar with the concept of communication channels being tapped. Tapping or sniffing can be done on both a small and large scale. Secret services use entire nodes of our ISPs (Internet Service Providers) for tapping, and on a smaller scale, this can of course also be done in your company or at home. There are, of course, several measures that can be taken to compromise a communication channel. In this article, however, I would like to focus on what is known as “sniffing.”\nWhat is sniffing? Sniffing refers to the interception or recording of data packets in a communication connection. For example, the clients of one of the two communication partners are compromised with malware containing a sniffing tool, and the data packets sent and received are then recorded. If these data packets are transmitted unencrypted, they may also contain passwords, which are then transmitted in plain text and can be read and used by the attacker.\nPlease note! None of the measures shown here offer 100% protection against attacks!\nWhat measures help against network sniffing? Network components First, it is important to divide a network into its components (network components) in order to implement appropriate protective measures for these network components. The network components are divided into two groups:\u0026gt; Wenn Sie Fragen oder Feedback zu diesem Blog oder YouTube-Kanal haben, nutzen Sie bitte meine Hilfeseite. Dort finden Sie Fragen und Antworten zu den verschiedenen Beiträgen. Sie können dort auch gerne Ihre eigene Frage stellen.\nActive network components Passive network components What are active network components? Active network components are devices that actively process and amplify signals and require a power supply to do so. Active network components include:\nFirewalls Switches Hubs Routers Access points Network cards ISDN cards **etc. What are passive network components? Passive network components are components in the network that do not require a power supply. Passive network components include:\nNetwork cabling Patch cables Network connection sockets **etc. Measures to protect active network components from network sniffing attacks Access control To protect active network components, access to the administration interface (SSH or web browser) should be securely protected, and unused ports should be disabled on managed switches. For example, unused ports on a switch should be protected against unauthorized access by external influences.\nMonitoring endpoints in the network (client and server) High priority for protection against sniffing is above all that the endpoints in the network are protected by suitable monitoring tools (protection against malware by antivirus software, IPS, etc.). Sniffing tools are particularly dangerous for reading network traffic at endpoints, as encryption can be easily circumvented at the endpoints of a data connection, for example by using the “https - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure” protocol (end-to-end encryption). Furthermore, it cannot be emphasized enough that it is essential to install security patches for the operating system and software used in a timely manner and that this should be done conscientiously. It is easy for attackers to take control of a system riddled with security vulnerabilities by using \u0026gt; Wenn Sie Fragen oder Feedback zu diesem Blog oder YouTube-Kanal haben, nutzen Sie bitte meine Hilfeseite. Dort finden Sie Fragen und Antworten zu den verschiedenen Beiträgen. Sie können dort auch gerne Ihre eigene Frage stellen. exploits and other scripts! Therefore, I would like to emphasize this point: Please note! Always install security updates for your operating system and the software you use! This procedure cannot be emphasized enough! Furthermore, you should not work with administrative privileges, but assign restricted user rights for daily work on your PC. You can ensure this in Windows, for example, by using a standard user account. This minimizes the risk of accidentally installing malicious programs.\nNetwork sniffing – encryption of communication A really important and highly recommended security measure is to use encrypted connections whenever possible. These encrypted connections, such as “https”, “sftp”, “SSH” and the use of VPN connections in public Wi-Fi networks protect you from attacks by ‘sniffing’ and also from “man-in-the-middle attacks”. However, it should be noted that security is only guaranteed with end-to-end encryption, i.e. from computer to computer or computer to server. End-to-end encryption should also be used for messaging apps to prevent third parties from eavesdropping. The messaging apps Signal, Wire and Threema (Telegram only encrypts “secure chats” to a limited extent) use end-to-end encryption to protect connections, making these messengers the clear choice for secure communication over competitors such as WhatsApp or similar standard messenger apps! Furthermore, when selecting Wi-Fi networks, you should also ensure that they use a secure encryption standard.\nMeasures to protect passive network components from network sniffing attacks To protect passive network components, you should, for example, ensure that access to the server room in companies is restricted so that only authorized personnel can enter this room. Network distribution cabinets in other parts of the building should also be lockable and secured against unauthorized access. Unused network connections can be secured with mechanical locks, known as port locks (e.g., these ones from Lindy). In general, it is recommended that only managed switches be used for data packet distribution in corporate networks, as these actively prevent unauthorized access by third parties by disabling unused network ports.\nConclusion – Network sniffing attacks If you follow and implement the security tips I have listed in this article, the risk of your data connections being spied on, eavesdropped on, or read should be minimized.\nHowever, the greatest danger in an IT network is and remains the user themselves. Most attacks on a computer network are caused by careless actions. This danger can only be minimized by educating users and should be a high priority when eliminating sources of danger in your computer network infrastructure. A good example of this is the famous abandoned USB stick that is quickly plugged into a computer. Raising awareness of this issue is the first rule in a secure IT environment. However, one thing should be clear: there is no such thing as absolute protection!\nWrite to me!\nIf you have any questions, don\u0026rsquo;t like something, or have found any errors, please leave a comment.

In this article, I would like to answer the question “How does a firewall work” with the help of the OSI layer model, among other things. In order to ensure security in a network, it is of course extremely important to understand how a firewall works. In this article, I will therefore attempt to explain the individual functions of a firewall in a way that is easy to understand. This will enable you to control data traffic optimally according to your requirements. If we want to explain how a firewall works, we should first take a closer look at the OSI layer model.\nHow does a firewall work – OSI layer model OSI layer model – How does a firewall work? The OSI model is divided into seven layers, of which only layers 3, 4, and 7 are relevant to firewalls.\nOSI model layer 3 – network layer The network layer is responsible for switching connections (performance-oriented services) and, in the case of packet-oriented services, for forwarding data packets. It is important that packets do not enter other layers, but are forwarded from node to node. If the “sender” and “receiver” cannot be reached directly, the packets are always assigned a new intermediate destination (node) until the actual destination is reached. The task of the network layer is to assign addresses to the packets, negotiate and ensure a certain quality of service, update the routing tables, and establish the routing itself.\nHardware used in this layer: Router Layer 3 switch Protocols used in this layer: IP, IPsec, ICMP, X25 (WAN), CLNP OSI model Layer 4 - Transport layer The transport layer is responsible for segmenting the data stream and preventing congestion. The segments are called service data units and are transported at the fourth layer. For addressing purposes, the data segment is assigned a fourth layer address, which is then the port. This data segment is then encapsulated in a data packet and enters the third layer (network layer).\nProtocols: TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP OSI model layer 7 – Application layer The application layer provides functions for applications (their communication). This is where connections to the lower layers are established and where data is entered and outputted.\nApplications (apps): Email programs, messaging (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.), browsers What is a firewall? A firewall is a security system that uses rules to protect a network area from unauthorized access. The firewall itself is not able to detect attacks on the network independently, as it only works on a rule-based system.\nBasic functions of a firewall The basic function of a firewall is to use packet filters. These packet filters work according to static rules and check each data packet individually, but cannot establish connections to previous packets. An advanced form of packet filtering is known as stateful inspection. This type of packet filtering recognizes and checks individual relationships between the monitored data packets.\nHow packet filtering works In packet filtering, data packets are identified by a network address and either forwarded to their destinations or blocked. To implement these guidelines, the header information of the individual data packets is evaluated and handled according to these rules. Packet filtering thus operates in the transport layer (layer 4, port), network layer (layer 3, IP address) and, in some stateful firewalls, also in the application layer (layer 7, here the user data) of the OSI model.\nHow stateful inspection packet filtering works Stateful inspection is a dynamic type of packet filtering. Here, each connection request is specified in more detail. Relationships to requested data packets and transmitted data packets are examined, allowing the permitted data packets to be assigned more accurately. This ensures that only the communication partners involved can access the connection.\nHow does a firewall work – types of firewalls Personal firewall A personal firewall, also known as a desktop firewall, is security software that monitors the communication of a single computer. Personal firewalls are available individually or as part of many antivirus security solutions from well-known manufacturers. Whether this type of security solution is recommended from the point of view of your computer\u0026rsquo;s security is open to question. I wrote an article on this topic some time ago. In the\nExternal firewall An external firewall, also known as a hardware firewall, monitors communication, depending on the hardware configuration, either on an internal network (LAN, e.g. company network) or between several subnets and other network segments (WAN, e.g. the Internet) to prevent unauthorized access. For the sake of clarity, the term hardware firewall is a little misleading here. This is because a firewall is always based on software. Hardware firewall only describes the fact that this security software is housed on separate hardware.\nQuestions and answers If you have any questions or feedback about this blog or YouTube channel, please use my help page.
