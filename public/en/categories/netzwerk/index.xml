      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;protection-against-man-in-the-middle-attacks&#34;&gt;Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post - &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure-bits.org/man-in-the-middle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Understanding Man-in-the-Middle Attacks&lt;/a&gt; - I explained what Man-in-the-Middle attacks are and what exactly they mean. In this post, I would like to give you some tips and tricks to help you protect yourself against such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the protective measures presented here cannot be implemented in their entirety by you, as they naturally depend on the infrastructure you use. This means, for example, whether you have your own domain or which hardware components you use in your network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
