# a summary about you
summary: I am a passionate IT security specialist with over 20 years of professional experience. Sometimes I work on exciting projects such as writing **Bash scripts, Ansible, Terraform, Python**, and **supporting open source projects**. But above all, I devote myself to **my favorite project, “Helping Hands,”** which **helps people with mental health issues**. I believe that technology is not only there to solve problems, but also to improve people's lives. That's why I am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to help others and make the world a little bit better.
