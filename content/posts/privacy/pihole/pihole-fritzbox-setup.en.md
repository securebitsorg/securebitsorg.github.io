## FritzBox + Pihole - Configure correctly so that all devices use Pi-hole as their DNS server
In this video on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@secure_bits/), I show you how to configure the **FritzBox** correctly so that all devices and software use the **Pi-hole** as the DNS server in the network and cannot bypass it.
There are certainly some devices and software in your internal network that have a so-called hard-coded IP address for a public DNS server (**hardcoded**).
In this video, I show you how to get these devices to always use the Pi-hole DNS server.
