## Creating Bash scripts made easy!
For users who are not yet familiar with creating/writing Bash scripts, getting started with Bash script writing and formatting can be a major hurdle.
That's why I came up with the idea of developing a “drag and drop” script editor and making it available to anyone interested!

Here is the **Bash Script Maker** I programmed, now available on GitHub and the relevant package manager as an open source version, which I will continue to equip with new features.
