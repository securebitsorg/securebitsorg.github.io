## The most important thing first!
It is important to note that the use of **nmap**, **outside of its test/laboratory or production environment**, **may only be done with the consent of its owner**!
{{< /alert >}} 
</br>
</br>
With this article, I hope to give you a clear understanding of the powerful tool ‘**nmap**’ and also provide you with a **PDF download of the most commonly used nmap commands**.
**Nmap** is ideal for putting your IT infrastructure through its paces and is also the first vector in 99% of cases when penetration testing systems.
## What is Nmap?
**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is an open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. As an IT security professional, Nmap is one of the most important tools in your arsenal for assessing network security. It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

**Main purposes of Nmap:**
- Real-time information about a network
- Detailed information about all active IPs on the network
- Number of open ports on a network
- Provide a list of active hosts
- Port, OS, and host scanning
- 
## Installing Nmap
Nmap is available in most Linux distributions and can be easily installed:

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install nmap
```
**CentOS/RedHat:**
```bash
yum install nmap
```
**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install nmap
```
## Basic syntax
The basic syntax of Nmap is
```bash
nmap [scan type(s)] [options] {target specification}
```
### Call nmap-help

```bash
nmap -h
```
</br>

![Ausgabe nmap help nmap -h](/images/posts/it-security/nmap-help.png)

**Output nmap -h**


## Important scan techniques in detail

### 1. TCP SYN scan (-sS) - The “stealth” scan
The **TCP SYN scan** is the standard and most popular scan option. It is also known as a “stealth scan” or “half-open scan” because it never establishes complete TCP connections.
```bash
nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
```
**How it works:**
- Sends SYN packets to target ports
- For open ports: Receives SYN/ACK response
- For closed ports: Receives RST response
- For filtered ports: No response (firewall)
**Advantages:**
- Fast and inconspicuous
- Works against any TCP stack
- Clear distinction between open, closed, and filtered
### 2. TCP Connect Scan (-sT)
The **TCP Connect Scan** performs the complete TCP handshake.
```bash
nmap -sT 192.168.1.1
```
**When to use:**
- When root privileges are not available
- For more accurate results on certain systems
### 3. UDP Scan (-sU)
**UDP scanning** is important for services such as DNS, SNMP, and DHCP.
```bash
nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
```
**Special features:**nmap-help aufrufen
- Slower than TCP scans
- More difficult to interpret
- Important for complete security assessment
## Operating system detection
Nmap can detect remote operating systems through TCP/IP stack fingerprinting.
```bash
nmap -O 192.168.1.1
```
**How it works:**
- Sends TCP and UDP packets to the target system
- Analyzes virtually every bit in the responses
- Compares results with a database of over 2,600 OS fingerprints
**Advanced OS detection:**
```bash
nmap -O --osscan-guess 192.168.1.1    # Aggressive detection
nmap -O --osscan-limit 192.168.1.1    # Only for good targets
```
## Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
The **Nmap Scripting Engine** is one of the most powerful features of Nmap. It allows you to use Lua scripts for advanced tasks.
### Script categories:
- **auth** - Authentication scripts
- **broadcast** - Broadcast scripts
- **default** - Default scripts
- **discovery** - Discovery scripts
- **dos** - Denial of service scripts
- **exploit** - Exploit scripts
- **fuzzer** - Fuzzing scripts
- **intrusive** - Intrusive scripts
- **malware** - Malware detection
- **safe** - Safe scripts
- **version** - Version detection
- **vuln** - Vulnerability scripts
### NSE examples:
```bash
nmap -sC 192.168.1.1                    # Standard scripts
nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.1          # Vulnerability scripts
nmap --script http-* 192.168.1.1        # All HTTP scripts
nmap --script smb-vuln-* 192.168.1.1    # SMB vulnerability scripts
```
## Timing templates
Nmap offers 6 timing templates for different speed and stealth requirements:
| Template | Name       | Description                      | Usage                      |
|:-------- |:---------- |:--------------------------------- |:------------------------------- |
| -T0      | Paranoid   | Very slow (5 min delay) | IDS bypass                    |
| -T1      | Sneaky     | Slow (15 sec delay)     | IDS bypass                    |
| -T2      | Polite     | Polite (0.4 sec delay)    | Resource conservation              |
| -T3      | Normal     | Standard (parallel)               | Standard                        |
| -T4      | Aggressive | Fast                           | Modern, reliable networks     |
| -T5      | Insane     | Very fast                      | Local networks, may be inaccurate |
**Recommendations for IT security:**
- **Internal audits:** -T4 for fast results
- **External penetration tests: -T2 or -T3 for less conspicuousness
- **Stealth assessments: -T0 or -T1

## Practical use cases for IT security managers
### 1. Network discovery
```bash
# Find active hosts on the network
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
# Detailed host information
nmap -A 192.168.1.0/24
```
### 2. Vulnerability assessment
```bash
# Perform vulnerability scan
nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.100
# Specific vulnerability checks
nmap --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 192.168.1.100
```
### 3. Service inventory
```bash
# Record all services and versions
nmap -sV -p- 192.168.1.100
# Top 1000 ports with service detection
nmap -sV --top-ports 1000 192.168.1.0/24
```
### 4. Firewall testing
```bash
# Test firewall rules
nmap -sA 192.168.1.100
# Combine different scanning techniques
nmap -sS -sU -A 192.168.1.100
```
### 5. Stealth reconnaissance
```bash
# Inconspicuous reconnaissance
nmap -T1 -f --source-port 53 192.168.1.100
# With decoy IPs
nmap -D RND:10 192.168.1.100
```
## Legal and ethical considerations
As an IT security manager, you should keep the following points in mind:
1. **Authorization:** Only use Nmap on your own networks or with explicit permission
2. **Documentation: Document all scans for compliance purposes
3. **Minimal impact: Use appropriate timing templates
4. **Test environment: Use scanme.nmap.org for testing
## Best practices for IT security managers
### 1. Regular network audits
- Weekly discovery scans with `-sn`
- Monthly full port scans with `-sV`
- Quarterly vulnerability assessments with NSE scripts
### 2. Automation and reporting
```bash
# Automated scanning with reporting
nmap -sV -A --script vuln -oA monthly_audit_$(date +%Y%m%d) 192.168.1.0/24
```
### 3. Monitoring changes
- Compare regular scans to detect new services
- Monitor open ports and services
- Document all changes
## Conclusion - nmap
Nmap is an indispensable tool for anyone working in IT security and should also be used by every administrator to check the IT landscape they are responsible for. Mastering its many features allows you to perform effective security assessments, identify vulnerabilities, and continuously improve the security posture of your network.
I sincerely hope that this brief overview has given some of you a good overview of the **nmap** tool and that nothing stands in the way of its future use.
