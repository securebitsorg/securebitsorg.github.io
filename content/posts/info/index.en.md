## Note about this blog / wiki

**Thank you for visiting this blog/wiki!**

From time to time, I post tips or tutorials that I think are useful for you, which are divided into the categories below. I hope that this type of blog/wiki presents the topics in a clearer and more concise manner.

Those of you who have been visiting my blog for a while (and there are quite a few of you) will notice that I have made some changes. I have now created this blog as a static page rather than a database-driven page (WordPress). The reason for this is simply that, in future, this website is intended to serve as a purely **informative source of information about me and IT topics**.
