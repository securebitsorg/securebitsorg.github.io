## What happened here?!
Those of you who have been following my blog or YouTube channel for a while will notice that, apart from the visual appearance, a few other things have changed.
I would like to briefly introduce and summarize all the changes here.
### Why a different design?
As you can undoubtedly see, the blog has a new design. This is because I have separated from my old CMS ‘WordPress’ and have now switched to a static website, which I run with the content generator [Hugo.io](https://gohugo.io/).

**There were several reasons for switching to a static website:**

- No PHP backend
- Quick overview for interested parties (customers) of the skills I have to offer
- Faster loading times
- Greater security
- Restructuring of the website
- More privacy for you

### Where has the community forum gone?
Some of you will have noticed, at the latest when you landed on the 404 page, that the community forum no longer exists in its old form.

#### Why is the community forum no longer available?
There are several reasons for this, which I would like to share with you.
- In my opinion, the forum plugin we were using was not as good as we had hoped and caused me more and more work due to errors, which was not exactly confidence-inspiring in my eyes. For example, the media files were not backed up during regular backups of the WordPress site and could not be restored when we moved to a new server.
- Furthermore, I think that errors during the login/registration process in the community forum meant that many of you simply didn't feel like continuing to use the forum.

#### Will there be another community forum?
At the moment, there are no plans to bring back a forum of this kind on this blog.

> **However**, there will still be a place for all of you who are interested to exchange ideas in a different form. For this purpose, I am using a self-hosted ticket system ( [Zammad](https://zammad.org/) ) which also offers a **Q&A page** where you can publicly ask questions and find the answers you are looking for.
Here you also have the option of creating your own tickets via email or web form, and the answers to the questions will then be published in anonymized form.
This also makes life easier for me, as I don't have to answer some questions ten times ;) .

### Where has the comment function gone?
At the moment, I haven't found a privacy-friendly comment solution for a static website that meets my requirements in terms of functionality and privacy.
> The disadvantage of a static website is that there is no backend for storing content and therefore no built-in comment function is available.
If I find something acceptable in the future, I will implement this feature again.

### And what about the newsletter?
As already explained in the question about the comment function, the situation is similar with a newsletter solution. In the past, I used a self-hosted solution as a newsletter backend to ensure as much privacy as possible for you.
Unfortunately, I haven't found a suitable solution for this yet.
> Here, too, I am open to suggestions from you!
## The future...
I really hope that this website will continue to offer you added value and help you answer your questions, assist you with your projects, or remain a good place to go for more information on my [**YouTube videos**](https://www.youtube.com/@secure_bits).


**In any case, I hope you continue to enjoy visiting this blog and that my tutorials are helpful to you!**
