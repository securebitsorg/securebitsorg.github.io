In this video, I'll show you how you can use AdGuard DNS to protect devices in your home network from ads, tracking, phishing, and malware.

### What does FritzBox / AdGuard DNS offer?
**AdGuard DNS is “your personal” public recursive DNS server** that you can customize to your individual needs with block lists, application control, parental controls, and time profiles.
You also have the option of encrypting your public DNS queries using various encryption protocols (DNS over TLS, DNS over HTTPS, DNS over Quic, and DNSCrypt), giving you one more building block to protect your personal data.
Another advantage is that you can also use your AdGuard DNS server when you are on the move, so you are always protected.

### Alternative to AdGuard DNS
**As an alternative to AdGuard DNS, I can also recommend the NextDNS service. This offers an even wider range of functions.**
